<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reason I have written this work is because so many
among us are interested in Tolstoy and so few seem to understand
him. It would seem therefore that an English Life
of Tolstoy is needed, and having lived in Russia for twenty-three
years, known Tolstoy well for several years, visited
him frequently in Moscow, and stayed with him repeatedly
at Yásnaya Polyána, I am perhaps as well qualified as any
one to write it, especially as I have long made a careful
study of his views. My wife and I have translated several
of his works, have known people closely connected with him,
and some ten years ago we took part in an unsuccessful
'Tolstoy' Colony; besides which I went to Canada at his
wish to make arrangements for the Doukhobór migration,
of which I subsequently wrote the history.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am impartial. That is to say, I have taken
pains to understand Tolstoy's views, and to see the good
there is in them; but being a Westerner, I see also certain
things Tolstoy overlooks, and I know that these things
knock big holes in some of his most cherished 'principles.'</p>

<p>The book has had the great advantage of being carefully
revised by his wife, the Countess S. A. Tolstoy, who
both verbally and in writing has rendered me most valuable
assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
I owe sincere thanks also to my friend P. I. Birukóf,
Tolstoy's Russian biographer. He modestly speaks of his
own work as 'a collection of those materials for the biography
of Leo Tolstoy which are accessible to me.' I have no
hesitation in saying that his care and integrity in gathering
and using those materials, entitle him to the gratitude of
all who deal with the same subject.</p>

<p>There is one small matter of typography which needs a
word of explanation. I have sought to tell as much of
the story as possible in Tolstoy's own words, and have
also had occasion to quote other writers. At times the
Russian text quoted contains allusions or expressions which
might perplex an English reader unless a word or two of
explanation were added. To introduce paragraphs of explanation
would interrupt the narrative, besides lengthening
the book. To have recourse to frequent footnotes in
cases where two or three words of explanation are all that
is required is unsightly and unsatisfactory; so I have
adopted the plan of using square brackets [ ] to enclose
such explanations. The ordinary round parentheses ( ) I
have kept for their common use, and for cases where, for
clearness' sake, words are added that are not contained in
the original.</p>

<p>Beyond indicating the varying value of sums of money
mentioned, I have not troubled the reader with the
fluctuations of the rouble, which went from over 38
pence before the Crimean war, to 19 pence after the
Russo-Turkish war of 1878. If he wants a concise history
of the Russian currency, he can find it in the preface to my
edition of <i>Sevastopol</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
In that as in other matters I have tried to be accurate
without being pedantic. It is Tolstoy and his views that
I aim at presenting to English readers; and I have kept
in the background, as far as I could, the obstacles resulting
from the Tower of Babel.</p>

<h2 id="note">NOTE ON PRONUNCIATION OF
RUSSIAN NAMES</h2>


<p>The spelling of Russian names in Latin letters in a work of
this kind, presents great difficulties. To begin with, we
have as yet (though it is much needed) no accepted method
of transliteration from Russian into English; and though it
is not difficult for any one to frame or select his own
system of transliteration&mdash;as I have done for my translations&mdash;this
does not entirely meet the case when one has to deal
with the names of people, many of whom have adopted a
spelling of their own.</p>

<p>On the one hand, a man has a right to decide how he
will have his own name spelt; but on the other hand, the
inclusion of a dozen different systems of transliteration in
one book, is apt to create confusion.</p>

<p>I have had to do the best I could under the circumstances.
To pronounce the names correctly, in accord
with the system of transliteration I have adopted, the reader
should note the following:</p>

<p class="i2">I. Lay stress on the syllable marked with an accent.</p>

<p class="i2">II. Vowel sounds are broad and open:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>a</i> as in f<i>a</i>ther.</div>
<div class="line"><i>e</i> as <i>a</i> in f<i>a</i>te.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="i2">But <i>e</i> initial and unaccented is pronounced <i>ye</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>i</i> as <i>ee</i> in m<i>ee</i>t.</div>
<div class="line"><i>o</i> as in l<i>o</i>ch.</div>
<div class="line"><i>u</i> as <i>you</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
In diphthongs the broad sounds are retained:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>ou</i> as <i>oo</i> in b<i>oo</i>t.</div>
<div class="line"><i>ya</i> as in <i>ya</i>rd.</div>
<div class="line"><i>ye</i> as in <i>ye</i>s.</div>
<div class="line"><i>yo</i> as in <i>yo</i>re.</div>
<div class="line"><i>ay</i> as <i>eye</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>ey</i> as in th<i>ey</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>oy</i> as in b<i>oy</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="i2">III. <i>y</i> with a vowel forms a diphthong; <i>y</i> at the end of a
word, after a consonant, sounds something like <i>ie</i> in hyg<i>ie</i>ne.</p>

<p class="i2">IV. Consonants:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>G</i> is hard, as in <i>g</i>o.</div>
<div class="line"><i>Zh</i> is like <i>z</i> in a<i>z</i>ure.</div>
<div class="line"><i>R</i> is sounded strongly, as in <i>r</i>ough, ba<i>rr</i>en.</div>
<div class="line"><i>S</i> is sharp, as in <i>s</i>eat, pa<i>ss</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Where I know of a spelling deliberately adopted by the
owner of a name, I have felt bound to follow it. For
instance, the name which under my system of transliteration
I should have spelt 'Suhotín,' appears in the book as
Soohoteén, but in such cases, on the first occasion on which
the name occurs, I have given my usual transliteration in
square brackets.</p>

<p>I hope the day is not distant when some system will be
generally agreed upon in this matter. Any system would
be better than the present anarchy.</p>

ANCESTRY AND PARENTAGE</h2>

<p class="i2">Ancestors. Count Peter. Russian titles. Tolstoy's grandfather
and father. His maternal grandfather and mother.
First recollections. Aunty Tatiána. Antecedents.</p>


<h3>1353</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the annals of the Russian nobility it is recorded that
a man named Idris came from 'the lands of Cæsar,'
that is to say, from the Holy Roman Empire, in
the year 1353 with two sons and 3000 followers,
and settling at Tchernígof in Little Russia was received
with favour by the reigning Grand Duke, who granted
him much land. A great-grandson of this Idris, Andrew
by name, migrated to Moscow, where he was well received
by the reigning Grand Duke Vasíly, who conferred upon
him the surname of Tolstóy.</p>


<h3>1645</h3>

<p>As, however, the annals of the Russian nobility were
to a large extent concocted in the reign of Peter the
Great, it is extremely doubtful whether this story is
reliable. Be that as it may, it is certain that
Peter Tolstoy, born in 1645, was a Russian who
distinguished himself in the service of the State. During
the struggles which preceded the acquisition of power
by Peter the Great, he made the mistake of allying
himself with that autocrat's ambitious half-sister, Sophia.
The defeat of her Guards, the Streltsí, caused him quickly
to transfer his allegiance to Peter, whose favour he eventually
managed to secure. When drinking with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
chosen companions in later days, the Tsar would often
pat Tolstoy's head, saying, 'Little head, little head, had
you been less wise, you would have come off your shoulders
long ago.'</p>


<h3>1697, 1716, 1717</h3>

<p>This Peter Tolstoy held a commission in the Guards,
and fought in the Azof campaign of 1696; but later on
he went abroad to study shipbuilding when Peter
the Great was seeking volunteers for that purpose.
He was sent in 1701 as Ambassador to the Sublime
Porte, and in the years 1710-1713, when political
affairs were critical, he twice suffered severe imprisonment
in the Seven Towers&mdash;the stronghold wherein the Sultan
occasionally confined the ambassadors of States with whose
conduct he felt dissatisfied. Returning to Russia in 1714,
Tolstoy obtained the favour of Prince Ménshikof and
became a Minister of State. He married; but his wife
does not appear to have been of sufficient importance for
any one to have said anything about her. He
accompanied Peter the Great to Holland and
France, and rendered him an important though discreditable
service. Peter the Great's son, the refractory
Alexis, who disliked his father's reforms, had
escaped from Russia and was living with his
mistress Euphrosyne at St. Elmo, near Naples. By
threats and promises, and by the aid of this woman,
Tolstoy induced the unfortunate Tsarévitch to return to
Russia, and when he had got him there, took a leading
part in his trial and secret execution.</p>


<h3>30 Aug. 1725</h3>

<p>For this service Tolstoy received large estates and
was promoted to the headship of the Secret Chancellery.
On the day of the coronation of Peter's second
wife, Catherine, Tolstoy was made a Count.
His coat of arms shows seven towers, in memory of
his imprisonment by the Sultan, and is appropriately
supported by two wolf-hounds rampant, looking outwards.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>


<h3>6 May 1727, 1729</h3>

<p>On the death of Peter the Great, Tolstoy actively
supported Ménshikof in securing the throne for Catherine
the First, and he was one of the seven members of the
Upper Secret Council which practically ruled Russia.
On the question of choosing a successor to Catherine, he
ventured however to oppose Ménshikof. The latter was
too powerful for him; and forfeiting his title of Count
and deprived of all offices rewards and estates, Tolstoy,
at the age of eighty-two, was banished for life to
the Solovétz Monastery, situated on an island in
the White Sea. Here, two years later, he died. Ménshikof
himself, one may remark in passing, finished his life
that same year in Siberia, having been banished by
an order signed by the boy he had placed on the
throne. To be a Russian Minister of State in those days
was almost as dangerous as it is in our times to be a
revolutionary conspirator.</p>

<p>The title of Count was revived in the family in 1770,
for the benefit of Peter Tolstoy's grandson; whose son,
Count Elias Tolstoy (he figures in <i>War and Peace</i> as the
elder Count Rostóf), was the grandfather of Leo Tolstoy,
whose life this book narrates.</p>

<p>There is one matter which it may be as well to explain
at the outset, as English readers are so often puzzled by
it: I refer to the nature of Russian titles of nobility.
The only really Russian title is that of <i>Knyaz</i>, commonly
translated 'Prince.' It is borne by descendants of Rúrik,
by descendants of the Lithuanian Prince Ghedimin, and
by descendants of various Tartar Khans whose dominions
Russia has annexed. It has also been conferred by
Imperial Decree on a dozen or more other Russian
families. Though <i>Knyaz</i> is translated 'Prince,' <i>Velíky
Knyaz</i>, curiously enough, is not translated 'Great Prince,'
but 'Grand Duke,' and this indicates how difficult it is to
find suitable equivalents for these titles. Not till the
time of Peter the Great were the German titles, Count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
(<i>Graf</i>) and Baron, introduced into Russia. Both of
these are now common among the Russo-German landlords
of the Baltic Provinces; and less so among real Russians.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that there is no law of
primogeniture in Russia. Each son and daughter inherits
the family title, so that there are usually several, and
sometimes many, people with equal rights to use the same
title. Though springing from one stock, they may be
only distantly connected. There are for instance other
Counts Tolstoy, contemporaries of Leo Tolstoy and distant
cousins of his. One of these, the poet Count Alexis
Tolstoy, was a well-known author and dramatist. Another,
the reactionary Count Dmítry Tolstoy, was successively
Head of the Holy Synod, Minister of Education, and
Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's grandfather already mentioned, Count Elias
Tolstoy, was an easy-going generous trustful and extravagant
man, who married a wealthy Princess Gortchakóf,
but ran through her money and his own, and at last
to secure a means of livelihood, procured the post of
Governor of Kazán. This he was able to do, thanks to
his family influence. It is recorded to his credit that, contrary
to the general custom of the time, he accepted no
bribes (except from the Government contractor, who was
considered the natural financial prop of a Provincial
Governor), though his wife accepted presents without his
knowledge.</p>

<p>Their eldest daughter married a Count Osten-Saken.
She became guardian of Leo Tolstoy and of his brothers
and sister, after they had lost their parents. Another
daughter married V. I. Úshkof. Leo Tolstoy was under
her charge when he lived in Kazán and studied at its
University.</p>

<p>The first fact known to us about his father, Count
Nicholas Tolstoy, is characteristic of the manners of his
class and day. When he was only sixteen, his parents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
arranged a <i>liaison</i> between him and a peasant girl, such
connections being considered necessary for the health of
young men. A son was born, and Tolstoy records his
'strange feeling of consternation when (in after years) this
brother of mine, fallen into destitution and bearing a
greater resemblance to my father than any of us, used to
beg help of us, and was thankful for the ten or fifteen
roubles we used to give him.'</p>


<h3>1812, 1814</h3>

<p>Nicholas Tolstoy was not yet seventeen when Napoleon invaded
Russia; but in spite of his parents' efforts to dissuade
him, he insisted on entering the army, and thanks
to his mother's family influence, quickly obtained
an appointment as Adjutant to Prince Andrew Gortchakóf,
a General in command. He went through the campaigns
of 1813 and 1814; and in the latter year he
and his orderly, while on their way to rejoin
the Russian army in Germany, after taking despatches to
Petersburg, were captured by the French. The orderly
managed to hide his master's gold coins in his boots, and
for months never risked taking them off, though his feet
grew sore and he suffered extreme discomfort. Thanks to
this devotion, Nicholas Tolstoy, after reaching Paris, was
able to live in comfort.</p>

<p>Having attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, he
left the army when the war was over, and, disillusioned
with military service, returned to Kazán, where his father
(completely ruined by that time) was still Governor.</p>


<h3>1820</h3>

<p>In 1820 Count Elias died, leaving his estate so encumbered
that his son declined to accept the inheritance.
The young man had to face the task of providing
for his old mother, who was accustomed to great
luxury, as well as for his sister and a distant cousin,
Tatiána Alexándrovna Érgolsky, who had been adopted
into the family; and so a marriage was arranged for him
with the wealthy but plain Princess Marie Volkónsky,
who was no longer very young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>His father's life, Tolstoy tells us, was then</p>

<p class="i2">passed in attending to the estate, a business in which he was
not very expert, but in which he exercised a virtue great for
those days: he was not cruel, but perhaps even lacked firmness.
During his lifetime I never heard of corporal punishment. If it
ever was administered to the serfs, the cases were so rare and my
father took so little part in them, that we children never heard
them mentioned. It was after his death that I learnt, for the
first time, that such punishment ever took place at home.</p>

<p class="i2">Like most men who served in the army in the early years of
Alexander's reign, he [Count Nicholas Tolstoy] was not what
is now called a Liberal, but out of self-respect he considered
it impossible to serve during the latter [reactionary] part of
Alexander's reign, or under Nicholas. During all my childhood
and youth, our family had no intimate relations with any
Government official. I, of course, understood nothing about
this in childhood, but I understood that my father never
humbled himself before any one, nor altered his brisk, merry,
and often chaffing tone. This feeling of self-respect, which
I witnessed in him, increased my love and admiration for him.</p>

<p>Leo Tolstoy's mother's family, the Volkónskys, were descended
from Rúrik (the first ruler mentioned in Russian
history) as well as from St. Michael the martyr, Prince of
Tchernígof; and through them, even more than on his
father's side, Tolstoy is connected with many of the leading
families of the Russian aristocracy. Prince Nicholas Volkónsky,
his mother's father, came into conflict with the
most powerful of the favourites of Catherine the Great,
for Tolstoy tells us that:</p>


<p class="i2">Having attained the high position of Commander-in-Chief,
he lost it suddenly by refusing to marry Potémkin's niece and
mistress, Varvára Engelhardt. To Potémkin's suggestion that
he should do so, he replied: 'What makes him think I will
marry his strumpet?'</p>

<p>He married instead, a Princess Catherine Troubetskóy,
and after retiring from the service, settled down on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
estate at Yásnaya Polyána. His wife soon died, leaving
him only one surviving child, a daughter, Tolstoy's mother.
Tolstoy writes of this grandfather:</p>

<p class="i2">He was regarded as a very exacting master, but I never heard
any instance of his being cruel or inflicting the severe punishments
usual in those days. I believe such cases did occur
on his estate, but the enthusiastic respect for his importance
and cleverness was so great among the servants and peasants
whom I have often questioned about him, that though I have
heard my father condemned, I have heard only praise of my
grandfather's intelligence, business capacity, and interest in the
welfare both of the peasants and of his enormous household.</p>

<p>Later, a strange chance brought Prince Volkónsky again
into touch with Varvára Engelhardt, whom he had refused
to marry. She married a Prince Sergius Golítsin, who
consequently received promotions and decorations and
rewards; and Tolstoy tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">With this Sergius Golítsin and his family, my grandfather
formed so close a friendship that my mother from her childhood
was betrothed to one of his ten sons.... This alliance, however,
was not destined to be consummated, for the young man
died prematurely of fever.</p>

<p>In a portrait of Prince N. Volkónsky which has been preserved
in the family there is much that corresponds to
Leo Tolstoy's own appearance. 'Both,' as his brother-in-law
remarks, 'have high, open foreheads and large organs
of the creative faculty, and in both the organs of musical
talent are exceedingly prominent and are covered by thick,
overhanging eyebrows, from beneath which small, deep-set,
grey eyes literally pierce the soul of the man on whom they
are turned.'</p>


<h3>1822</h3>

<p>Prince N. Volkónsky died in 1820, and two years later
his daughter married Count Nicholas Tolstoy. Of
her Tolstoy tells us:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I do not remember my mother. I was a year-and-a-half old
when she died. By some strange chance no portrait of her
has been preserved, so that as a real physical being I cannot
picture her to myself. I am in a way glad of this, for in my
conception of her there is only her spiritual figure, and all that
I know about her is beautiful; and I think this has come about
not merely because all who spoke to me of my mother tried to
say only what was good, but because there actually was much
good in her.</p>

<p>She was well educated, spoke five languages, played the
piano well, and had a wonderful gift for improvising tales
in the most delightful manner. It is said that at balls her
young lady friends would leave the dance and gather in a
dark room to hear her tell a story, which shyness induced
her to do where she could not be seen. Tolstoy remarks
that 'her most valuable quality was that though hot-tempered,
she was yet self-restrained. "She would get
quite red in the face and even cry," her maid told me,
"but would never say a rude word."' She had one quality
Tolstoy values very highly&mdash;that of never condemning any
one. It was a quality shared by her eldest son, Nicholas;
and Leo Tolstoy says:</p>

<p class="i2">In the <i>Lives of the Saints</i> by D. Rostóvsky, there is a short
story which has always touched me exceedingly, of a certain
monk, who to the knowledge of all his brethren had many
faults, but whom an old monk, in a dream, saw occupying a
place of honour among the saints. The old man asked in
astonishment, 'How could this monk, so unrestrained in many
ways, deserve so great a reward?' The answer was: 'He
never condemned any one.'</p>

<p>Tolstoy adds: 'If such rewards did exist, I think my
brother and my mother would have received them.'</p>

<p>Another feature Tolstoy records of his mother is 'her
truthfulness and the simple tone of her correspondence.'
He tells us that in his imagination his mother</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
appeared to me a creature so elevated, pure and spiritual,
that often in the middle period of my life, during my struggles
with overwhelming temptations, I prayed to her soul begging
her to aid me; and such prayer always helped me much.</p>


<h3>1828</h3>

<p>Five children were born to Nicholas and Marie Tolstoy.
First came four sons, of whom Leo was the youngest.
His name in Russian is Lyóf Nikoláyevitch (Leo, son-of-Nicholas)
Tolstóy. Leo Tolstoy is the way he signs himself
when using the Latin alphabet; and when pronouncing
his name it should be remembered that the accent falls on
the second syllable, and that that syllable rhymes with
'boy.' The fancy spellings <i>Tolstoi</i> and <i>Tolstoï</i> are due to
the fact that some of the early translators and reviewers,
not being able to read Russian, relied on French versions,
and did not know how Tolstoy spells or pronounces his own
name. He was born on 28th August 1828<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at
Yásnaya Polyána, with a caul&mdash;which both in
Russia and in England is considered a sign of good-fortune.</p>

<p>A year and a half later a daughter, Marie, was born;
and in giving birth to her the mother died, on 7th March
1830.</p>

<p>Pilgrims, monks, nuns, and various half-crazy devotees
were frequent visitors at the house, and even took up their
abode there. One of these was a nun, Márya Gerásimovna,
who in her youth had made pilgrimages to various
holy places dressed as a man. After the birth of four
boys Tolstoy's mother longed for a daughter, and promised
Márya Gerásimovna that she should be godmother if
by prayer she enabled her to obtain her desire. The next
child really was a daughter. The promise was kept, and
thereafter Márya Gerásimovna, though she lived partly in
the Toúla convent, was free of the Tolstoys' house and
spent much of her time there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Tolstoy gives us his earliest reminiscences in an autobiographical
fragment published in 1878:</p>

<p class="i2">These are my first recollections. I cannot arrange them in
order, for I do not know which come first or last. Of some of
them I do not even know whether they happened in a dream
or when I was awake. I lie bound<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and wish to stretch out
my arms, but cannot. I scream and cry, and my screams are
disagreeable to myself, but I cannot stop. Some one&mdash;I do not
remember who&mdash;bends over me. This all happens in semi-darkness.
I only know there were two people there. My
cries affect them: they are agitated by my screams, but do not
untie me as I want them to, and I scream still louder. To
them it seems necessary that I should be bound, but I know it
is unnecessary and I wish to prove this to them, and I again
burst into cries which are unpleasant to myself but are yet unrestrainable.
I feel the injustice and cruelty&mdash;not of people,
for they pity me, but&mdash;of fate, and I pity myself. I do not
know and shall never know, what it was all about: whether I
was swaddled while still a baby at the breast, and struggled to
free my hands; whether they swaddled me when I was more
than a year old, to prevent my scratching some sore, or whether
I have gathered into this one recollection (as one does in a
dream) many different impressions. The one sure thing is,
that this was the first and strongest impression of my life.
And what remains on my memory is not my cries nor my
suffering, but the complexity and contradictoriness of the impressions.
I desire freedom, it would harm no one, but I who
need strength am weak, while they are strong.</p>

<p class="i2">The next impression is a pleasant one. I am sitting in a tub,
and am surrounded by a new and not unpleasant smell of something
with which they are rubbing my tiny body. Probably it
was bran, put into the water of my bath; the novelty of the
sensation caused by the bran aroused me, and for the first time
I became aware of, and liked, my own little body with the
visible ribs on my breast, and the smooth, dark, wooden tub,
the bared arms of my nurse, the warm, steaming, swirling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
water, the noise it made, and especially the smooth feel of the
wet rim of the tub as I passed my hands along it.</p>

<p class="i2">My next recollections belong to the time when I was five or
six, and there are very few of them, and not one that relates to
life outside the walls of the house. Nature, up to the age of
five, did not exist for me. All that I remember, happened in
bed or in our rooms. Neither grass, nor leaves, nor sky, nor
sun existed for me. It cannot be that no one ever gave me
flowers and leaves to play with, that I never saw any grass, that
they never shaded me from the sun; but up to the time when
I was five or six years old, I have no recollection of what we
call Nature. Probably, to see it, one has to be separate from
it, and I was Nature.</p>

<p class="i2">The recollection that comes next after the tub is that of
Ereméyevna. 'Ereméyevna' was the name with which they
used to frighten us children. Probably they had long frightened
us with it, but my recollection of it is this: I am in bed and
feel well and happy as usual, and I should not remember it, but
that suddenly the nurse, or some one of those who made up my
life, says something in a voice new to me, and then goes away;
and in addition to being happy I am also frightened. And
besides me there is some one else like me. (Probably my sister
Mary, whose crib stood in the same room.) And I now remember
a curtain near my bed; and both my sister and I are
happy and frightened at the strange thing happening to us,
and I hide in my pillow: hide, and glance at the door from
behind which I expect something new and merry. We laugh,
and hide, and wait. And then some one appears in a dress and
cap quite unknown to me, but I recognise that it is the same
person who is always with us (whether my nurse or aunt I do
not remember), and this some one says something about bad
children and about Ereméyevna in a gruff voice which I know.
And I squeal with fear and pleasure, and really am frightened,
and yet am glad to be frightened, and wish her who is frightening
me not to know that I have recognised her. We become
quiet, but presently begin whispering to one another again, on
purpose that Ereméyevna may come back.</p>

<p class="i2">I have another recollection similar to this of Ereméyevna
(but as it is clearer it probably belongs to a later date) which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
has always remained inexplicable to me. In this recollection
the chief part is played by our German tutor, Theodore Ivánitch,
but I am sure I was not yet in his charge; so the event must
have taken place before I was five. It is my first recollection
of Theodore Ivánitch, and it took place at so early an age that
I can remember no one else: neither my brothers nor my
father nor any one. If I have some notion of some one
individual person, it is only of my sister, and this only because
she, like me, was afraid of Ereméyevna. With this recollection
is joined my first conception of the fact that our house had
a top story. How I climbed there&mdash;whether I went by myself
or whether any one carried me&mdash;I have quite forgotten, but
I remember that many of us are there, and we all form a circle
holding each other's hands; among us are some women I did
not know (for some reason I remember that they were washer-women),
and we all begin to go round and to jump; and
Theodore Ivánitch jumps, lifting his legs too high and too
loudly and noisily, and I at one and the same instant feel
that this is bad and depraved, and notice him and (I believe)
begin to cry&mdash;and all is over.</p>

<p class="i2">That is all I remember up to the age of five. Neither my
nurses, aunts, brothers, sister, nor my father, nor the rooms,
nor my toys, do I remember. My more distinct recollections
begin from the time I was moved downstairs to Theodore
Ivánitch and the elder boys.</p>

<p class="i2">When I was moved downstairs to Theodore Ivánitch and the
boys, I experienced for the first time and therefore more
strongly than ever since, the feeling which is called the sense
of duty, the consciousness of the cross every man is called upon
to bear. It was hard to leave what I was accustomed to from
the beginning of things, and I was sad, poetically sad, not
so much at parting from people: sister, nurse, and aunt, as at
parting with my crib, the curtain and the pillow; and I feared
the new life into which I was entering. I tried to see the jolly
side of this new life awaiting me; I tried to believe the caressing
words with which Theodore Ivánitch lured me to him. I tried
not to see the contempt with which the boys received me, the
youngest boy. I tried to think it was a shame for a big boy to live
with girls, and that there was nothing good in the life upstairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with nurse; but my heart was terribly sad, I knew I was irreparably
losing my innocence and happiness; and only a feeling of
personal dignity and the consciousness of doing my duty upheld
me. (Often in after-life I have experienced similar moments
at the parting of crossroads, when entering on a fresh course.)
I experienced quiet grief at the irreparableness of my loss;
I was unable to believe that it would really happen. Though
I had been told that I should be moved to the boys' rooms,
I remember that the dressing-gown with a cord sewn to its
back, which they put on me, seemed to cut me off for ever
from upstairs, and I then for the first time observed&mdash;not
all those with whom I had lived upstairs, but&mdash;the chief person
with whom I lived, and whom I did not remember before.
This was my Aunty Tatiána Alexándrovna Érgolsky. I remember
her short, stout, black-haired, kindly, tender, and
compassionate. It was she who put the dressing-gown on me,
and embracing me and kissing me, tied it round my waist;
and I saw that she felt as I did, that it was sad, terribly sad, but
had to be; and for the first time I felt that life is not a game
but a serious matter.</p>

<p>'Aunty' Tatiána Alexándrovna Érgolsky, mentioned in
the above reminiscences, was a very distant relative who
being left an orphan, had been brought up by Tolstoy's
paternal grandparents. She was very attractive and affectionate.
She loved and was loved by Count Nicholas,
Leo's father, but stood aside that he might marry the rich
Princess Marie Volkónsky and repair the family fortunes.
Six years after his wife's death Count Nicholas asked
Tatiána to marry him and be a mother to his children.
Not wishing (Tolstoy tells us) to spoil her pure, poetic
relations with the family, she refused the first but fulfilled
the second of these requests.</p>

<p>The joyousness of Tolstoy's boyhood was largely due to
the care and affection of this excellent woman, and in the
most firmly rooted of his principles&mdash;such as his detestation
of corporal punishment and his approval of complete
chastity&mdash;it is easy to trace her unconscious influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Here for instance is one episode:</p>

<p class="i2">We children were returning home from a walk with our
tutor, when near the barn we met the fat steward, Andrew,
followed by the coachman's assistant, 'Squinting Kouzmá' as
he was called, whose face was sad. He was a married man and
no longer young. One of us asked Andrew where he was
going, and he quietly replied that he was going to the barn,
where Kouzmá had to be punished. I cannot describe the
dreadful feeling which these words and the sight of the good-natured
crestfallen Kouzmá produced on me. In the evening
I told this to my Aunt Tatiána, who hated corporal punishment
and, wherever she had influence, never allowed it for us any
more than for the serfs. She was greatly revolted at what
I told her, and rebuking me said, 'Why did you not stop him?'
Her words grieved me still more.... I never thought that we
could interfere in such things, and yet it appeared that we
could. But it was too late, and the dreadful deed had been
done.</p>

<p>To sum up what we know of Tolstoy's antecedents:
he was descended on his father's side and still more on his
mother's, from aristocratic families who were more or less in
passive opposition to the Government, and who shared the
humanitarian sympathies current in the early years of the
reign of Alexander I. A cousin of Tolstoy's mother was
one of the Decembrists, and on the accession of Nicholas I
in 1825 took part in their abortive attempt to establish
Constitutional Government. He was exiled to Eastern
Siberia for thirty years, doing hard labour in irons part of
the time. His wife (another Princess Marie Volkónsky)
voluntarily accompanied him, as Nekrásof has told in a well-known
Russian poem. Several members of the family
towards the end of their lives retired into convents or
monasteries.</p>

<p>We find strong family love uniting the homes of Tolstoy's
parents and grandparents; and even after their death,
Tolstoy's nature ripened in a congenial atmosphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
family affection; and many of his most pronounced sympathies
and antipathies are not peculiar to himself, but
were shared equally by other members of the family.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Yásnaya Polyána</span> (Bright Glade), where Tolstoy was born,
had been an ancestral estate of the Volkónskys and belonged
to his mother, the Princess Marie. It is situated ten
miles south of Toúla, in a pleasantly undulating country.
The estate, which is enclosed by an old brick wall, is well
wooded and has many avenues of lime-trees, a river and
four lakes. In Tolstoy's grandfather's time, sentinels kept
guard at the small, round, brick towers, which now stand
neglected at the entrance of the main birch avenue leading
to the house. Something of the great confidence in himself
and readiness to despise others, which despite all his
efforts to be humble, characterise Tolstoy, may be due to
the fact that he was born and grew up on an estate where
for generations his ancestors had been the only people of
importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
'Aunty' Tatiána Alexándrovna Érgolsky had been
brought up by his grandmother on an equality with her
own children. She (Tatiána) was resolute, self-sacrificing,
and, says Tolstoy,</p>

<p class="i2">must have been very attractive with her enormous plait of
crisp, black, curly hair, her jet-black eyes, and vivacious,
energetic expression. When I remember her she was more
than forty, and I never thought about her as pretty or not
pretty. I simply loved her eyes, her smile, and her dusky
broad little hand, with its energetic little cross vein.</p>

<p class="i2">We had two aunts and a grandmother; they all had more
right to us than Tatiána Alexándrovna, whom we called Aunt
only by habit (for our kinship was so distant that I could never
remember what it was), but she took the first place in our upbringing
by right of love to us (like Buddha in the story of the
wounded swan), and we felt her right.</p>

<p class="i2">I had fits of passionately tender love for her.</p>

<p class="i2">I remember once, when I was about five, how I squeezed in
behind her on the sofa in the drawing-room and she caressingly
touched me with her hand. I caught it and began to kiss
it, and to cry with tender love of her....</p>

<p class="i2">Aunty Tatiána had the greatest influence on my life. From
early childhood she taught me the spiritual delight of love.
She taught me this joy not by words; but by her whole being
she filled me with love. I saw, I felt, how she enjoyed
loving, and I understood the joy of love. This was the first
thing.</p>

<p class="i2">Secondly, she taught me the delights of an unhurried, quiet
life.</p>

<p>Another, though a much less important, influence was
that of the tutor, Theodore Rössel (who figures as Karl
Ivánovitch Mauer in Tolstoy's early sketch, <i>Childhood</i>).
Tolstoy owes his excellent knowledge of German and French
to the fact that his father, following a custom common among
well-to-do Russians, engaged foreign teachers and let his
children learn languages not so much from books as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
conversation, while they were still quite young. Rössel's
'honest, straightforward, and loving nature' helped to develop
the boy's good qualities.</p>

<p>Tolstoy got on well, too, with his brothers, who were
five-and-a-half, two, and one year older than himself, as
well as with his little sister Marie, his junior by a year-and-a-half.</p>

<p>He not only loved, but deeply respected, his eldest
brother Nicholas (pet name, Nikólenka), whose influence
lasted until, and even after, his death in 1860. Of him
Tolstoy says:</p>

<p class="i2">He was a wonderful boy, and later a wonderful man. Tourgénef
used to say of him very truly, that he only lacked certain
faults to be a great writer. He lacked the chief fault needed
for authorship&mdash;vanity, and was not at all interested in what
people thought of him. The qualities of a writer which he
possessed were, first of all, a fine artistic sense, an extremely
developed sense of proportion, a good-natured gay sense of
humour, an extraordinary inexhaustible imagination, and a
truthful and highly moral view of life; and all this without the
slightest conceit. His imagination was such that for hours
together he could tell fairy-tales or ghost-stories, or amusing
tales in the style of Mrs. Radcliffe, without a pause and with
such vivid realisation of what he was narrating that one forgot
it was all invention.... When he was not narrating or reading
(he read a great deal) he used to draw. He almost
invariably drew devils with horns and twisted moustaches,
intertwined in the most varied attitudes and engaged in the
most diverse occupations. These drawings were also full of
imagination.</p>

<p class="i2">It was he who, when I was five and my brothers, Dmítry
six and Sergéy seven, announced to us that he possessed a
secret by means of which, when disclosed, all men would
become happy: there would be no more disease, no trouble, no
one would be angry with anybody, all would love one another,
and all would become 'Ant-Brothers.'... We even organised
a game of Ant-Brothers, which consisted in sitting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
chairs, sheltering ourselves with boxes, screening ourselves with
handkerchiefs, and cuddling against one another while thus
crouching in the dark.... The Ant-Brotherhood was revealed
to us, but not the chief secret: the way for all men to cease
suffering any misfortune, to leave off quarrelling and being
angry, and become continuously happy; this secret he said he
had written on a green stick, buried by the road at the edge of
a certain ravine, at which spot (since my body must be buried
somewhere) I have asked to be buried in memory of Nikólenka.
Besides this little stick, there was also a certain Fanfarónof
Hill, up which he said he could lead us, if only we would fulfil
all the appointed conditions. These were: first, to stand in a
corner and not think of a white bear. I remember how I used
to get into a corner and try (but could not possibly manage)
not to think of a white bear. The second condition was to
walk without wavering along a crack between the boards of
the floor; and the third was, for a whole year not to see a
hare, alive or dead or cooked; and it was necessary to swear
not to reveal these secrets to any one. He who fulfilled these,
and other more difficult conditions which Nikólenka would
communicate later, would have one wish, whatever it might be,
fulfilled.</p>

<p class="i2">Nikólenka, as I now conjecture, had probably read or heard
of the Freemasons&mdash;of their aspirations toward the happiness
of mankind, and of the mysterious initiatory rites on entering
their order; he had probably also heard about the Moravian
Brothers [in Russian <i>ant</i> is <i>mouravéy</i>].</p>

<p>Writing when he was over seventy, Tolstoy adds:</p>

<p class="i2">The ideal of ant-brothers lovingly clinging to one another,
though not under two arm-chairs curtained by handkerchiefs, but
of all mankind under the wide dome of heaven, has remained the
same for me. As I then believed that there existed a little
green stick whereon was written the message which could
destroy all evil in men and give them universal welfare, so I
now believe that such truth exists and will be revealed to men,
and will give them all it promises.</p>

<p>It was, however, Tolstoy's second brother, Sergius (or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Sergéy: pet name, Seryózha), whom Tolstoy in his young
days most enthusiastically admired and wished to imitate.
Sergius was handsome, proud, straightforward, and singularly
sincere. Of him Leo Tolstoy says:</p>

<p class="i2">I loved and wished to be like him. I admired his handsome
appearance, his singing (he was always singing), his drawing,
his gaiety and especially (strange as it may seem to say so)
the spontaneity of his egotism. I myself was always aware of
myself and self-conscious; I always guessed, rightly or wrongly,
what other people thought or felt about me, and this spoilt my
joy in life. This probably is why in others I specially liked
the opposite feature&mdash;spontaneity of egotism. And for this I
specially loved Seryózha. The word <i>loved</i> is not correct. I
loved Nikólenka; but for Seryózha I was filled with admiration
as for something quite apart from and incomprehensible
to me.</p>

<p>Of the third brother, Demetrius (or Dmítry: pet name,
Mítenka), only a year older than himself, Tolstoy tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">I hardly remember him as a boy. I only know by hearsay
that as a child he was very capricious. He was nearest to me
in age and I played with him oftenest, but did not love him as
much as I loved Seryózha, nor as I loved and respected Nikólenka.
He and I lived together amicably. I do not recollect
that we quarrelled. Probably we did, and we may even have
fought.... As a child I remember nothing special about
Mítenka except his childish merriment.</p>

<p>Tolstoy says he was 'afraid of beggars, and of one of the
Volkónskys, who used to pinch me; but, I think, of no
one else.'</p>

<p>A girl, Doúnetchka Temeshóf, was adopted as a member
of the family. She was a natural daughter of a wealthy
bachelor friend of Tolstoy's father.</p>

<p class="i2">I remember how, when I had already learnt French, I was
made to teach her that alphabet. At first it went all right (we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
were both about five years old), but later she probably became
tired, and ceased to name correctly the letters I pointed out.
I insisted. She began to cry. I did the same, and when our
elders came, we could say nothing owing to our hopeless tears.</p>

<p>In his later recollections of her he says:</p>

<p class="i2">She was not clever, but was a good, simple girl; and, above
all, so pure that we boys never had any but brotherly relations
with her.</p>

<p>By which he means that there was no flirtation.</p>

<p>The relations between the family and its servants, who
were serfs (and of whom there were about thirty), were, as
in many a Russian family, often really affectionate. One
instance of a serf's devotion has already been quoted; and
such cases were not rare. In <i>Childhood</i> mention is made
of the old housekeeper, Praskóvya Isáyevna, who was completely
devoted to the welfare of the family, and Tolstoy
says: 'All that I there wrote about her was actual
truth.'</p>

<p>Here is another example illustrating both kindly toleration
of minor offences committed by a serf, and the family
affection which sweetened life:</p>

<p class="i2">My pleasantest recollections of my father are of his sitting
with grandmother on the sofa, helping her to play Patience.
My father was polite and tender with every one, but to my
grandmother he was always particularly tenderly submissive.
They used to sit&mdash;Grandma playing Patience, and from time to
time taking pinches from a gold snuff-box. My aunts sit in
arm-chairs, and one of them reads aloud. We children come in
to say good-night, and sometimes sit there. We always take
leave of Grandma and our aunts by kissing their hands. I
remember once, in the middle of a game of Patience and of the
reading, my father interrupts my aunt, points to a looking-glass
and whispers something. We all look in the same direction.
It was the footman Tíkhon, who (knowing that my father was
in the drawing-room) was going into the study to take some
tobacco from a big leather folding tobacco-pouch. My father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sees him in the looking-glass, and notices his figure carefully
stepping on tip-toe. My aunts laugh. Grandmama for a long
time does not understand, but when she does, she too smiles
cheerfully. I am enchanted by my father's kindness, and on
taking leave of him kiss his white muscular hand with special
tenderness.</p>

<p>An important feature of the life in which Tolstoy grew
up was furnished by the half-crazy saints who swarmed in
Russia in those days, and are still occasionally to be
met with. Readers of <i>Childhood</i> will remember Grísha, an
admirable specimen of that class, about whom Tolstoy
makes the following characteristic note in his memoirs:</p>

<p class="i2">Grísha is an invented character. We had many of these
half-crazy saints at our house, and I was taught to regard them
with profound respect, for which I am deeply grateful to those
who brought me up. If there were some among them who
were insincere, or who experienced periods of weakness and
insincerity, yet the aim of their life, though practically absurd,
was so lofty that I am glad I learned in childhood unconsciously
to understand the height of their achievement. They
accomplished what Marcus Aurelius speaks of when he says:
'There is nothing higher than to endure contempt for one's
good life.' So harmful and so unavoidable is the desire for
human glory which always contaminates good deeds, that one
cannot but sympathise with the effort not merely to avoid
praise, but even to evoke contempt. Such a character was
Márya Gerásimovna, my sister's godmother, and the semi-idiot
Evdokímoushka, and some others in our house.</p>

<p>How deeply these early impressions were engraved on
Tolstoy's mind is obvious from his earliest as well as his latest
writings. Take, for instance, the lines from <i>Childhood</i>
referring to Grísha's prayer overheard by the children.</p>

<p class="i2">Much water has flowed away since then, many recollections
of the past have lost for me their meaning and become blurred
fancies; even the pilgrim Grísha himself has long since finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
his last pilgrimage; but the impression he produced on me
and the feeling he evoked, will never die out of my memory.</p>

<p>In Tolstoy's later life we shall again and again find this
medieval note recurring (with whatever of truth or falsity
it contains), and the assertion that it is not the usefulness
or uselessness of a man's life that matters, so much as his
self-abnegation and the humility of his soul.</p>

<p>To complete the picture of Tolstoy's early boyhood at
Yásnaya Polyána, we must think of him as interested in
his father's dogs and horses and hunting (in <i>Childhood</i> he
tells the true story of how he hunted his first hare), and
also in the games and masquerades with which the family
and visitors, as well as the servants, amused themselves,
especially at New Year.</p>

<p>In spite of his sensitive introspective nature, Tolstoy's
childhood was a happy one; and to it he always looks back
with pleasure. He speaks of 'that splendid, innocent,
joyful, poetic period of childhood, up to fourteen,' and he
tells us that the impressions of early childhood, preserved
in one's memory, grow in some unfathomable depth of the
soul, like seeds thrown on good ground, till after many
years they thrust their bright, green shoots into God's world.</p>


<h3>1837</h3>

<p>When Tolstoy was eight years old the family moved to
Moscow for his elder brothers' education. The following
summer they lost their father, who, having gone to
Toúla on business, fell down in the street on his way
to visit his friend Temeshóf, and died of apoplexy. What
money he had with him was stolen, but some unnegotiable
bonds were brought back to the Tolstoys in Moscow by an
unknown beggar. The funeral took place at Yásnaya
Polyána; and Leo, who did not attend it, long fancied that
his father was not really dead. Looking at the faces of
strangers in the streets of Moscow, he felt almost certain he
might at any moment meet him alive again.</p>

<p>This event brought the problems of life and death
vividly to the boy's mind, and nine months later the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>pression
was intensified by the death of his grandmother,
who never recovered from the shock of her son's death.
Hers was the first death Tolstoy witnessed, and he never
forgot the horror he felt when, as she lay dying of dropsy,
he was admitted to kiss her swollen white hand and saw
her, dressed in white, lying motionless on a high white bed.
But he says:</p>

<p class="i2">I remember that new jackets of black material, braided with white,
were made for all of us. It was dreadful to see the undertakers'
men hanging about near the house, and then bringing in the coffin,
with its lid covered with glazed brocade, and my grandmother's
stern face, with its Roman nose, and her white cap and the white
kerchief on her neck, lying high in the coffin on the table; and
it was sad to see the tears of our aunts and of Páshenka; but yet
the new braided jackets and the soothing attitude adopted towards
us by those around, gratified us.... I remember how pleasant it
was to me to overhear during the funeral the conversation of some
gossiping female guests, who said, 'Complete orphans; their father
only lately dead, and now the grandmother gone too.'</p>

<p>Some time after this, an event occurred that is recorded
on the first page of Tolstoy's <i>Confession</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">I remember how, when I was about eleven, a boy Vladímir
Milútin (long since dead), a Grammar School pupil, visited us
one Sunday and announced as the latest novelty a discovery
made at his School. The discovery was that there is no God,
and all that we are taught about Him is a mere invention. I
remember how interested my elder brothers were in this news.
They called me to their council and we all, I remember,
became animated, and accepted the news as something very
interesting and fully possible.</p>

<p>Various stories have been preserved relating to Tolstoy's
boyhood, and some of them are sufficiently characteristic
to be worth repeating.</p>

<p>One incident which made a strong impression on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
lad, keenly sensitive as he always was to any shade of
injustice, was the following:</p>

<p>Soon after the death of their father and grandmother,
the orphan Tolstoys, then living in rather straitened
circumstances (owing to the property being left in trust),
were invited to a Christmas Tree at the house of an
acquaintance, and the young Princes Gortchakóf, nephews
of the then Minister of War, were also among the guests.
All the children received presents; but whereas the Gortchakófs
had expensive ones, the Tolstoys, to their annoyance,
received cheap common ones.</p>

<p>Another occurrence that clung to his recollection through
life, was the friendly welcome they received one day when
they made their way uninvited into a private garden in
Moscow; and the sad disappointment they experienced
when, returning a few days later unaccompanied by a
pretty and attractive girl who had been with them on the
former occasion, they were coldly informed that it was
private ground, not open to the public.</p>

<p>Other stories, told by Tolstoy himself or by the family,
illustrate his impulsive, imaginative, strenuous and rather
erratic nature at this period.</p>

<p>When he was about seven or eight years old he had an
ardent desire to fly, and persuaded himself that it was possible
to do so. It was only necessary to sit down tight
on your heels, clasping your arms firmly round your
knees, and the tighter you held them the higher you would
fly. As Tolstoy was always ardent to put his beliefs into
practice, it is not very surprising that one day, soon after
the family had moved to Moscow, he stayed behind in the
class-room when he should have come down to dinner, and
climbing out on the window-sill, some six yards from the
ground, threw himself out. He was picked up unconscious.
The ill results of his fall were fortunately confined to a
slight concussion of the brain; and after sleeping for
eighteen hours on end he woke up again quite well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
It would be a mistake to take his story, <i>Childhood</i>, as
strictly autobiographical; but it contains many passages
which one knows from other sources to be true of his own
life, and one such is the passage in which (speaking in the
character of Nikólenka) he says:</p>

<p class="i2">I knew very well that I was plain, and therefore every reference
to my appearance was painfully offensive to me....
Moments of despair frequently came over me: I imagined that
there could be no happiness on earth for a man with so broad
a nose, such thick lips, and such small grey eyes as mine.
I asked God to perform a miracle and change me into a handsome
boy, and all I then had and all I could ever possess in the
future, I would have given for a handsome face.</p>

<p>In fact, his personal appearance caused the sensitive lad
much concern, but his efforts to improve it were unsuccessful.
On one occasion he clipped his eyebrows, and the
unsatisfactory results of that operation occasioned him
great grief.</p>

<p>He records in his Reminiscences the following incident,
which certainly intensified his lifelong antipathy to corporal
punishment:</p>

<p class="i2">I do not remember for what, but for something quite undeserving
of punishment, St. Thomas [the resident French
tutor who succeeded Rössel] first locked me into a room, and
secondly threatened to flog me. I thereupon experienced
a dreadful feeling of anger indignation and disgust, not only
towards St. Thomas himself, but towards the violence with
which I was threatened.</p>

<p>When quite a small boy he conceived an attachment for
the nine-year-old daughter of his father's friend, Islényef,
and being jealous of her for daring to talk to others, he
angrily pushed her off a balcony, with the result that she
limped for a long time afterwards. A quarter of a century
later, when he married this lady's daughter, his mother-in-law
used laughingly to remind him of the incident, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
say, 'Evidently you pushed me off the balcony in my childhood
that you might marry my daughter afterwards!'</p>

<p>His sister relates that once when they were driving in a
troika (<i>i.e.</i> three horses abreast) to Yásnaya, Leo got down
during a break in the journey and went forward on foot.
When the carriage started again and began to overtake him
he took to running, and when the horses went faster he
also increased his speed, racing as hard as he could. He was
not overtaken till he had gone about two miles and was
completely tired out. He was lifted back into the carriage
gasping for breath, perspiring and quite exhausted. Any
one not endowed with the remarkable physical vigour that,
in spite of frequent attacks of ill-health, has characterised
Tolstoy through life, would probably have done themselves
serious injury had they taxed their vital resources as recklessly
as he often did.</p>

<p>All accounts agree in representing him as an original and
odd little fellow, unwilling to do things like other people.
He would for instance enter a drawing-room and, carefully
placing his feet together and bending his head, would
make his bow backwards, saluting each of the company
in turn.</p>

<p>Two incidents are recorded relating to the love of
riding which has remained a characteristic of his through
life.</p>

<p>When his brothers were sent to a riding-school, Leo (in
spite of his father's assurances and those of the riding-master
that he was too small to begin and would tumble off)
also obtained permission to learn to ride. At his first
lesson he duly tumbled off, but begged to be replaced in
the saddle; and he did not fall off again, but became an expert
horseman. In one of the short stories he wrote many
years later for the use of school-children, he tells how he
once wished to ride the old horse Raven after his brothers
had each had a turn on it; and how Raven being too tired
to move from the stables, he beat it till he broke his switch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
on its sides. He then demanded a stouter switch from the
serf in charge, but the man replied:</p>

<p class="i2">'Ah, master, you have no pity! Why do you beat him?
He is twenty years old, and is tired out; he can hardly breathe.
Why, for a horse, he is as old as Timoféyitch [a very old peasant
living at the place]. You might as well get on Timoféyitch's
back, and drive him beyond his strength like that, with a
switch. Would you feel no pity for him?'</p>

<p class="i2">I thought of Timoféyitch, and hearkened to the man. I got
off the horse's back; and when I noticed how its steaming
sides were working, and how heavily it breathed through its
nostrils, swishing its thin tail, I understood how hard it was
for it. Till then I had thought that it was as happy as I was
myself. And I felt so sorry for Raven that I began to kiss his
sweaty neck and to beg his pardon for having beaten him.</p>

<p class="i2">Since then I have grown up, but I always have pity on
horses, and always remember Raven and Timoféyitch when I
see horses ill-treated.</p>

<p>He does not appear to have been very good at his lessons,
and himself somewhere mentions the dictum of a student
who used to coach his brothers and himself, and said of their
aptitude for learning:</p>

<p class="i2">'Sergéy both wishes and can, Dmítry wishes but can't' (this
was not true), 'and Leo neither wishes nor can.' (This, I
think, was perfectly true.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, St. Thomas, the French tutor already
referred to (he figures in <i>Childhood</i> as St. Jérôme), must have
noticed the lad's capacity, for he used to say, '<i>Ce petit a une
tête: c'est un petit Molière</i>' (This little one has a head:
he is a little Molière).</p>


<h3>1837</h3>

<p>After the father's death the family property passed under
the control of the Court of Wards, and expenses had to be
cut down. It was therefore decided that, though
the two elder brothers had to remain in Moscow for
the sake of their education, the three younger children should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
return to Yásnaya Polyána, where living was cheaper, in
charge of their much loved Aunty Tatiána. Their legal
guardian, the Countess Alexandra ('Aline') Ilýnishna Osten-Saken,
remained in Moscow with the elder boys.</p>

<p>This lady had made what seemed a brilliant marriage with
the wealthy Count Osten-Saken, whose family was among the
first in the Baltic Provinces; but her married life was a
terrible one. Her husband went out of his mind and tried
to kill her. While he was confined in an asylum, the
Countess gave birth to a still-born child. To save her
from this fresh shock, a girl born of a servant, the wife of
a Court cook, was substituted for the still-born baby. This
girl, Páshenka, lived with the Tolstoy family, and was already
grown up when Tolstoy was quite a child. Subsequently
the Countess Alexandra lived first with her parents and
then with her brother, Tolstoy's father. Though she was
a devotee of the Orthodox Russo-Greek Church of which
Tolstoy eventually became so fierce an opponent, much in
her character and conduct accords with the precepts laid
down in his later writings; and it is evident that certain
aspects of his understanding of the Christian character,
which strike most Englishmen as peculiar, far from being
invented out of his own head, are derived from a deeply-rooted
Russian and family tradition. He tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">My aunt was a truly religious woman. Her favourite occupation
was reading the Lives of the Saints, conversing with
pilgrims, half-crazy devotees, monks and nuns, of whom some
always lived in our house, while others only visited my aunt....
She was not merely outwardly religious, keeping the fasts,
praying much, and associating with people of saintly life, but
she herself lived a truly Christian life, trying not only to avoid
all luxury and acceptance of service, but herself serving others
as much as possible. She never had any money, for she gave
away all she had to those who asked. A servant related to me
how, during their life in Moscow, my aunt used carefully on
tip-toe to pass her sleeping maid, when going to Matins, and used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
herself to perform all the duties which it was in those days
customary for a maid to perform. In food and dress she was
as simple and unexacting as can possibly be imagined. Unpleasant
as it is to me to mention it, I remember from childhood
a specific acid smell connected with my aunt, probably
due to negligence in her toilet: and this was the graceful
poetic Aline with beautiful blue eyes, who used to love reading
and copying French verses, who played on the harp, and
always had great success at the grandest balls! I remember
how affectionate and kind she always was, and this equally to
the most important men and women and to the nuns and
pilgrims.</p>

<p>Tolstoy goes on to tell how pleasantly she bore the jests
and teasing that her devotion to the priests brought upon
her.</p>

<p class="i2">I remember her dear good-natured laugh, and her face
shining with pleasure. The religious feeling which filled her
soul was evidently so important to her, so much higher than
anything else, that she could not be angry or annoyed at anything,
and could not attribute to worldly matters the importance
others attach to them.</p>


<h3>1840</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1839 the whole family assembled at
Yásnaya Polyána. The next year, 1840, was a famine
year. The crops were so poor that corn had to
be bought to feed the serfs, and to raise funds for
this purpose one of the Tolstoys' estates had to be sold.
The supply of oats for the horses was stopped, and Tolstoy
remembers how he and his brothers, pitying their ponies,
secretly gathered oats for them in the peasants' fields, quite
unconscious of the crime they were committing.</p>


<h3>1841</h3>

<p>In the autumn of that year the whole family moved to
Moscow, returning to Yásnaya for the following summer.
The next autumn their guardian, the kind good
Countess Alexandra Osten-Saken, died in the Convent
or 'Hermitage' founded by Óptin (a robber chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the fourteenth century) in the Government of Kaloúga, to
which she had retired.</p>

<p>After her death her sister, Pelagéya Ilýnishna Úshkof,
became their guardian. She was the wife of a Kazán landowner.
Aunty Tatiána and she were not on friendly
terms; there was no open quarrel between them, but V. I.
Úshkof (Pelagéya's husband) had been a suitor for Tatiána's
hand in his youth, and had been refused. Pelagéya could
not forgive her husband's old love for Tatiána.</p>

<p>The change of guardianship led to the removal of the
family to Kazán, and to the children being separated from
Aunty Tatiána, much to her grief.</p>

<p>The books which up to the age of fourteen, when he
went to Kazán, had most influenced Tolstoy were, he tells
us, the Story of Joseph from the Bible, the <i>Forty Thieves</i>
and <i>Prince Kamaralzaman</i> from the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, various
Russian folk-legends, Poúshkin's <i>Tales</i> and his poem
<i>Napoleon</i>, and <i>The Black Hen</i> by Pogorélsky. The influence
the story of Joseph had on him, he says, was 'immense.'</p>

<p>In his aptitude for abstract speculation, as in other
respects, the boy was truly father to the man; and in a
passage, certainly autobiographical, in <i>Boyhood</i>, he says:</p>

<p class="i2">It will hardly be believed what were the favourite and most
common subjects of my reflections in my boyhood&mdash;so incompatible
were they with my age and situation. But in my
opinion incompatibility between a man's position and his moral
activity is the surest sign of truth....</p>

<p class="i2">At one time the thought occurred to me that happiness does
not depend on external causes, but on our relation to them;
and that a man accustomed to bear suffering cannot be unhappy.
To accustom myself therefore to endurance, I would hold
Tatíshef's dictionaries in my outstretched hand for five minutes
at a time, though it caused me terrible pain; or I would go to
the lumber room and flog myself on my bare back with a cord
so severely that tears started to my eyes.</p>

<p class="i2">At another time suddenly remembering that death awaits
me every hour and every minute, I decided (wondering why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
people had not understood this before) that man can only be
happy by enjoying the present and not thinking of the future;
and for three days, under the influence of this thought, I abandoned
my lessons, and did nothing but lie on my bed and enjoy
myself, reading a novel and eating honey-gingerbreads, on
which I spent my last coins....</p>

<p class="i2">But no philosophic current swayed me so much as scepticism,
which at one time brought me to the verge of insanity. I
imagined that except myself no one and nothing existed in the
world, that objects are not objects but apparitions, appearing
only when I pay attention to them and disappearing as soon as
I cease to think of them. In a word, I coincided with Schelling
in the conviction that what exists is not objects, but only my
relation to them. There were moments in which under the
influence of this fixed idea, I reached such a stage of absurdity
that I glanced quickly round hoping to catch Nothingness by
surprise, there where I was not.</p>

<p class="i2">The philosophical discoveries I made greatly flattered my
vanity: I often imagined myself a great man, discovering new
truths for the benefit of humanity, and I looked on other mortals
with a proud consciousness of my own dignity; yet, strange to
say, when I came in contact with these mortals I grew timid
before each of them. The higher I stood in my own opinion
the less was I able to show any consciousness of my own dignity
before others, or even to avoid being ashamed of every word or
movement of my own&mdash;even the simplest.</p>

<p>At the time of the move to Kazán, a serf lad of about
his own age was presented to each of the young Tolstoys
to attend on him. Alexis, the one given to Leo Tolstoy,
remained in his service all his life, and died at Yásnaya a
few years ago.</p>


<h3>1841</h3>

<p>For five and a half years, from the autumn of 1841
to the spring of 1847, the brothers lived at Kazán, returning
each summer to Yásnaya for the vacation.
They all entered Kazán University. The aunt
who was their guardian, and with whom they lived the
greater part of the time, was a kind but not particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
clever woman. Her house was the centre of much
hospitality and gaiety.</p>


<h3>1844</h3>

<p>Leo Tolstoy prepared to enter the faculty of Oriental
Languages, in which a knowledge of Arabic and Turco-Tartar
was required. He worked hard, and matriculated
in May 1844 before he was sixteen, passing
in French (for which he received the mark 5+; 5 being
in an ordinary way the highest mark, and the + indicating
exceptional distinction), German, Arabic, and Turco-Tartar
very well, and in English, Logic, Mathematics and Russian
Literature, well; but he did indifferently in Latin, and
failed completely in History and Geography, getting the
lowest mark, a 1, for each of them. Of History he says,
'I knew nothing,' and of Geography 'still less'; adding,
'I was asked to name the French seaports, but I could
not name a single one.' At the end of the summer vacation
he was admitted for re-examination in the subjects in
which he had failed, and passed successfully.</p>


<h3>1844-1845</h3>

<p>The winter season when Tolstoy, as a student at the
University and a young man of good position, entered
Kazán society, was a particularly gay one. He
attended many balls, given by the Governor of the
Province, by the <i>Maréchal de la Noblesse</i>, and by private
people, as well as many masquerades, concerts, tableaux-vivants,
and private theatricals. He is still remembered
by old inhabitants as having been 'present at all the balls,
soirées, and aristocratic parties, a welcome guest everywhere,
and always dancing, but, far from being a ladies'
man, he was distinguished by a strange awkwardness and
shyness.' At Carnival time in 1845 he and his brother
Sergius took parts in two plays given for some charitable
object. His performance was a great success.</p>

<p>As to the nature of Kazán society and of his surroundings
there, accounts are contradictory. On the one hand,
we have his own statement that (imitating his brother
Sergius in this as in other matters) he became 'depraved.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Birukóf, too, speaks of 'the detestable surroundings of
Tolstoy's life in Kazán,' and another writer, Zagóskin, a
fellow-student of Tolstoy's at the University, says that the
surroundings in which the latter moved were demoralising
and must have been repellent to him. On the other hand,
on seeing Zagóskin's remarks, Tolstoy (in whom there is
often observable a strong spirit of contradiction) replied:</p>

<p class="i2">I did not feel any repulsion, but was very glad to enjoy
myself in Kazán society, which was then very good. I am on
the contrary thankful to fate that I passed my first youth in
an environment where a young man could be young without
touching problems beyond his grasp, and that I lived a life
which, though idle and luxurious, was yet not evil.</p>

<p>The explanation of these contradictions, no doubt, is that
the family circle in which Tolstoy lived was an affectionate
one, and that he himself not only enjoyed his life, but
formed friendships and made efforts at which in later
years he looked back with satisfaction. Yet there was
assuredly much in his life and in the life around him
which (except when others were severe on it) he recalled
with grave disapproval, a disapproval he has plainly
expressed in his <i>Confession</i>.</p>

<p>To come as near as we may to the truth, we must allow
for the personal equation which, in Tolstoy's case, is violent
and fluctuating.</p>

<p>With constant amusements going on around him, it is
not surprising that at the end of his first University year
he failed in his examinations. The failure does not however
appear to have been entirely his fault, for he tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">Ivanóf, Professor of Russian History, prevented me from
passing to the second course (though I had not missed a single
lecture and knew Russian History quite well) because he had
quarrelled with my family. The same Professor also gave me
the lowest mark&mdash;a 'one'&mdash;for German, though I knew the
language incomparably better than any student in our division.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3>1845</h3>

<p>Instead of remaining for a second year in the first course
of Oriental Languages, Tolstoy preferred to leave that
faculty, and in August 1845 he entered the faculty
of Law. During the first months of this new
course he hardly studied at all, throwing himself more
than ever into the gay life of Kazán society. Before midwinter
however he began for the first time, as he tells us,
'to study seriously, and I even found a certain pleasure in
so doing.' Comparative Jurisprudence and Criminal Law
interested him, and his attention was especially arrested
by a discussion on Capital Punishment. Meyer, Professor
of Civil Law, set him a task which quite absorbed him; it
was the comparison of Montesquieu's <i>Esprit des Lois</i> with
Catherine the Second's <i>Great Nakaz</i>. The conclusion to
which he came was, that in Catherine's <i>Nakaz</i> one finds
Montesquieu's Liberal ideas mixed with the expression of
Catherine's own despotism and vanity, and that the <i>Nakaz</i>
brought more fame to Catherine than good to Russia.</p>


<h3>1846</h3>

<p>He passed his examinations successfully in May 1846,
and was duly admitted to the second year's course of Jurisprudence.
Some time previously Tolstoy and
another student had disputed which of them had
the better memory, and to test this, each of them learnt
by heart the reply to one examination question in History.
Tolstoy's task was to learn the life of Mazeppa, and as
luck would have it that was just the question he happened
to draw at his examination, so that he naturally obtained
a 5, the highest mark.</p>

<p>From the autumn of 1846 the three brothers, Sergius
Demetrius and Leo, ceased to live at their aunt's, and
settled in a flat of their own, consisting of five rooms.</p>

<p>A fellow-student, Nazáryef, has given us his impression
of Tolstoy as a student. He says:</p>

<p class="i2">I kept clear of the Count, who from our first meeting repelled
me by his assumption of coldness, his bristly hair and
the piercing expression of his half-closed eyes. I had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
met a young man with such a strange and, to me, incomprehensible
air of importance and self-satisfaction....</p>

<p class="i2">At first I seldom met the Count, who in spite of his
awkwardness and bashfulness had joined the small group of
so-called 'aristocrats.' He hardly replied to my greetings, as
if wishing to intimate that even here we were far from being
equals, since he drove up with a fast trotter and I came on
foot....</p>

<p>It so happened that Nazáryef and Tolstoy were both
late for a lecture on History one day, and were incarcerated
together by order of the Inspector.</p>

<p>One gathers that Tolstoy was in those days particularly
careful of his personal appearance, his clothes indicating his
aristocratic pretensions. But though externally the Tolstoy
of 1846 differed greatly from the Tolstoy of forty years
later, his conversation ran on much the same lines as in
later life, and was uttered with the intensity of conviction
and the flashes of dry humour which have since made
even the most didactic of his writings so readable.</p>

<p>Their conversation in their place of confinement having
led to some mention of Lérmontof's poem, <i>The Demon</i>,
Tolstoy took occasion to speak ironically of verse generally,
and then, noticing a volume his companion had of
Karamzín's <i>History of Russia</i>, he</p>

<p class="i2">attacked History as the dullest and almost the most useless
of subjects. A collection of fables and useless details, sprinkled
with a mass of unnecessary figures and proper names....
Who wants to know that the second marriage of John the
Terrible, with Temrúk's daughter, took place on 21st August
1562; and his fourth marriage, with Anna Alexéyevna Koltórsky,
in 1572? Yet they expect me to grind all this, and if
I don't, the examiner gives me a 'one.'</p>

<p>Later on, says Nazáryef, 'the, to me, irresistible force
of Tolstoy's doubts fell upon the University, and on
University teaching in general. The phrase, "The Temple
of Science," was constantly on his lips. Remaining per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>fectly
serious himself, he portrayed our professors in such
a comical light that, in spite of all my efforts to appear
indifferent, I laughed like one possessed.... "Yet," said
Tolstoy, "we both had a right to expect that we should
leave this temple useful men, equipped with knowledge.
But what shall we really carry away from the University?...
What shall we be good for, and to whom shall we be
necessary?"</p>

<p>Nazáryef says that in spite of the feeling half of dislike,
half of perplexity, that Tolstoy evoked in him, he well
remembers that he was dimly conscious of something
remarkable, exceptional, and at the same time inexplicable,
about him.</p>

<p>From the educational articles Tolstoy wrote sixteen
years later, we know that he disapproved of examinations,
of the restricted groove of studies marked out for the
students in each faculty, and of the system which made
it necessary for the professors to deliver original lectures
of their own, and obliged the students to listen to those
lectures and to study them, however incompetent the
professors might be.</p>


<h3>1847</h3>

<p>The fact that his brother Sergius had finished his
studies and was leaving, strengthened Tolstoy's dissatisfaction
with the University; and finally, without waiting for
the May examinations at which he might have qualified
for the third year's course, we find him, soon after Easter
1847, applying to have his name removed from
the University roll 'on account of ill-health and
family affairs.' He really had been in hospital in March,
but the plea of ill-health was a mere excuse.</p>

<p>His failure to take a degree was a source of great
annoyance and disappointment to him, and it must not be
supposed that he left Kazán with any idea of taking life
easily or neglecting further study.</p>

<p>From the time he was a boy he had kept a diary of
every little sin he had committed, and especially of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
offence against the Seventh Commandment, in order that
he might repent, and if possible refrain for the future, and
his diary shows how full he was at this time of strenuous
resolutions. During the last year of his life at Kazán he
made close friends with a student named Dyákof (the
Nehlúdof of <i>Boyhood</i>), and under his influence had
developed</p>

<p class="i2">an ecstatic worship of the ideal of virtue, and the conviction
that it is man's destiny continually to perfect himself. To put
all mankind right and to destroy all human vices and misfortunes,
appeared a matter that could well be accomplished. It seemed
quite easy and simple to put oneself right, to acquire all the
virtues, and to be happy.</p>

<p>Here are some rules he set himself at that time:</p>

<p class="i2">1. To fulfil what I set myself, despite all obstacles.</p>

<p class="i2">2. To fulfil well what I do undertake.</p>

<p class="i2">3. Never to refer to a book for what I have forgotten, but
always to try to recall it to mind myself.</p>

<p class="i2">4. Always to make my mind work with its utmost power.</p>

<p class="i2">5. Always to read and think aloud.</p>

<p class="i2">6. Not to be ashamed of telling people who interrupt me,
that they are hindering me: letting them first feel it, but (if
they do not understand) telling them, with an apology.</p>

<p>Deciding to settle at Yásnaya for two years, he drew up
a list of studies he intended to pursue for his own mental
development, and to qualify for a University degree; and
this list was, as the reader will see, appalling in its
scope.</p>

<p class="i2">1. To study the whole course of law necessary to get my
degree.</p>

<p class="i2">2. To study practical medicine, and to some extent its theory
also.</p>

<p class="i2">3. To study: French, Russian, German, English, Italian, and
Latin.</p>

<p class="i2">4. To study agriculture, theoretically and practically.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="i2">5. To study History, Geography, and Statistics.</p>

<p class="i2">6. To study Mathematics (the High School course).</p>

<p class="i2">7. To write my [University] thesis.</p>

<p class="i2">8. To reach the highest perfection I can in music and
painting.</p>

<p class="i2">9. To write down rules (for my conduct).</p>

<p class="i2">10. To acquire some knowledge of the natural sciences, and,</p>

<p class="i2">11. To write essays on all the subjects I study.</p>

<p>Such rules and resolutions abound in Tolstoy's Diary.
After failing to act up to them, he again and again
gathers his energies and maps out for himself plans of life
and courses of study sufficient to tax the energies of an
intellectual giant.</p>

<p>As to his religious opinions at this time, he tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">I was baptized and brought up in the Orthodox Christian
faith. I was taught it in childhood and all through my boyhood
and youth. But before I left the University, in my
second year, at the age of eighteen, I no longer believed anything
I had been taught. (<i>Confession.</i>)</p>

<p>His Diary nevertheless shows that he prayed frequently
and earnestly; the fact no doubt being, that though
intellectually he discarded the Orthodox Russo-Greek
Church, in times of trouble or distress he instinctively
appealed to God for help. His opinions were wavering
and immature, as he himself tells us in another passage:</p>

<p class="i2">The religious beliefs taught me in childhood disappeared...
and as from the time I was fifteen I began to read philosophic
works, my rejection of those beliefs very soon became a conscious
one. From the age of sixteen I ceased going to Church
and fasting of my own accord. I did not believe what had
been taught me from childhood, but I believed in something.
What it was I believed in, I could not at all have said. I
believed in a God, or rather I did not deny God; but I could
not have said what sort of God. Neither did I deny Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and his teaching, but what his teaching consisted in I could
also not have said.</p>

<p class="i2">Looking back on that time now, I see clearly that my faith&mdash;my
only real faith, that which apart from my animal instincts
gave impulse to my life&mdash;was a belief in perfecting oneself.
But in what this perfecting consisted and what its object was,
I could not have said. I tried to perfect myself mentally&mdash;I
studied everything I could: anything life threw in my way;
I tried to perfect my will, I drew up rules which I tried to
follow; I perfected myself physically, cultivating my strength
and agility by all sorts of exercises and accustoming myself to
endurance and patience by all kinds of privations. And all
this I considered to be perfecting myself. The beginning of
it all was, of course, moral perfecting; but that was soon
replaced by perfecting in general: by the desire to be better,
not in one's own eyes or those of God, but in the eyes of
other people. And very soon this effort again changed into a
desire to be stronger than others: to be more famous, more
important and richer than others. (<i>Confession.</i>)</p>

<p>When speaking of Tolstoy's relations with women, it
should be borne in mind that incontinence for young men
was then considered so natural that few of them in his
position would have felt any serious qualms of conscience
about such visits to houses of ill-fame as he lets us know
that he began to pay at this time. His brother Dmítry
however led a chaste life, and alternating with gross
lapses of conduct, we find Leo noting down for his own
guidance such resolutions as the following:</p>

<p class="i2">To regard the society of women as a necessary unpleasantness
of social life, and to keep away from them as much as
possible. From whom indeed do we get sensuality, effeminacy,
frivolity in everything, and many other vices, if not from
women? Whose fault is it, if not women's, that we lose our
innate qualities of boldness, resolution, reasonableness, justice,
etc.? Women are more receptive than men, therefore in
virtuous ages women were better than we; but in the present
depraved and vicious age they are worse than we are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
During his years at the University, Tolstoy saw much of
his brother Dmítry, of whom he says:</p>

<p class="i2">I remember also at the University that when my elder
brother Dmítry, suddenly in the passionate way natural to
him devoted himself to religion and began to attend all the
Church services, to fast, and to lead a pure and moral life, we
all, and even our elders, unceasingly held him up to ridicule
and called him, for some unknown reason, 'Noah.' I remember
that Moúsin-Poúshkin (then Curator of Kazán University),
when inviting us to a dance at his house, ironically remonstrated
with my brother, who had declined the invitation, and
used the argument that even David danced before the Ark.
I sympathised with these jokes my elders made, and deduced
from them the conclusion that though it is necessary to learn
the catechism and go to church, one must not take such things
too seriously. (<i>Confession.</i>)</p>

<p>Again we read of this brother:</p>


<p class="i2">His peculiarities became manifest, and are impressed on my
mind from the time of our life at Kazán. Formerly in Moscow
I remember that he did not fall in love, as Seryózha and I did,
and was not fond of dancing or of military pageants, but studied
well and strenuously.... At Kazán I, who had always imitated
Seryózha, began to grow depraved.... Not only at Kazán,
but even earlier, I used to take pains about my appearance. I
tried to be elegant, <i>comme il faut</i>. There was no trace of anything
of this kind in Mítenka. I think he never suffered from
the usual vices of youth; he was always serious thoughtful
pure and resolute, though hot-tempered, and whatever he did,
he did to the best of his ability.... He wrote verses with
great facility. I remember how admirably he translated
Schiller's <i>Der Jüngling am Bache</i>, but he did not devote himself
to this occupation.... He grew up associating little with
others, always&mdash;except in his moments of anger&mdash;quiet and
serious. He was tall, rather thin, and not very strong, with
long, large hands and round shoulders. I do not know how or
by what he was attracted at so early an age towards a religious
life, but it began in the very first year of his University career.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
His religious aspirations naturally directed him to Church life,
and he devoted himself to this with his usual thoroughness.</p>

<p class="i2">In Mítenka there must have existed that valuable characteristic
which I believe my mother to have had, and which I
knew in Nikólenka, but of which I was altogether devoid&mdash;complete
indifference to other people's opinion about oneself.
Until quite lately (in old age) I have never been able to divest
myself of concern about people's opinion; but Mítenka was
quite free from this. I never remember on his face that
restrained smile which involuntarily appears when one is being
praised. I always remember his serious quiet sad, sometimes
severe, almond-shaped hazel eyes. Only in our Kazán days
did we begin to pay particular attention to him, and then
merely because, while Seryózha and I attached great importance
to what was <i>comme il faut</i>&mdash;to externalities&mdash;he was careless
and untidy, and we condemned him for this.</p>

<p class="i2">We others, especially Seryózha, kept up acquaintance with
our aristocratic comrades and other young men. Mítenka on
the contrary selected out of all the students a piteous-looking,
poor, shabbily dressed youth, Poluboyárinof [which may be
translated Half-noble]&mdash;whom a humorous fellow-student of
ours called Polubezobédof [Half-dinnerless]&mdash;and consorted
only with him, and with him prepared for the examinations....
We brothers, and even our aunt, looked down on Mítenka
with a certain contempt for his low tastes and associates;
and the same attitude was adopted by our frivolous comrades.</p>

<p>After their University days were over, Tolstoy saw
little of his brother Demetrius; so it will be convenient
here to sacrifice chronological sequence and say what more
there is to tell of the latter's life and death. The
material is again supplied by Tolstoy's Reminiscences.</p>

<p class="i2">When we divided up the family property, according to
custom the estate where we lived, Yásnaya Polyána, was
given to me. Seryózha, as a lover of horses and according
to his wish, received Pirogóvo, where there was a stud. To
Mítenka and Nikólenka were given the two other estates: to
Nikólenka, Nikolsky; to Mítenka, the Kursk estate, Sherbatchóvka.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I have kept a note of Mítenka's, showing how he
regarded the possession of serfs. The idea that it is wrong,
and that serfs ought to be liberated, was quite unknown in
our circle in the 'forties. The hereditary possession of serfs
seemed a necessary condition of life, and all that could be
done to prevent its being an evil, was to attend not only to
their material but also to their moral welfare. In this sense
Mítenka wrote very seriously naïvely and sincerely. Thinking
he could not do otherwise, he, a lad of twenty, when he
left the University took it upon himself to direct the morality
of hundreds of peasant families, and to do this (as Gógol
recommended in his <i>Letters to a Landowner</i>) by threats of
punishments and by punishments.... But, besides this duty
to his serfs, there was another duty which at that time it
seemed impossible not to fulfil: namely, Military or Civil
service. And Mítenka decided to enter the Civil Service.</p>

<p>Tolstoy proceeds to tell how his brother, desiring to be
useful to his country, chose legislation as his speciality,
and going to Petersburg astonished the Head of the
Department as well as certain aristocratic acquaintances by
asking where he could find a place in which he could be
<i>useful</i>. The friend to whom he went for advice, regarded
the service of the State merely as a means of satisfying
ambition, and 'such a question had probably never
occurred to him before.' Eventually we find Demetrius
returning home discouraged, and taking up some local
work. All this, to some extent, helps us to understand
Leo Tolstoy's sceptical attitude towards the institution of
Government, and his strong belief that men in Government
service are solely actuated by selfish motives.</p>

<p>Tolstoy continues:</p>

<p class="i2">After we had both left the University, I lost sight of him.
I know he lived the same severe, abstemious life, knowing
neither wine tobacco nor, above all, women, till he was
twenty-six, which was very rare in those days. I know also
that he associated with monks and pilgrims.... I think I
was already in the Caucasus when an extraordinary change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
took place. He suddenly took to drinking smoking wasting
money and going with women. How it happened I do not
know; I did not see him at the time. I only know that his
seducer was a thoroughly immoral man of very attractive
appearance, the youngest son of Islényef [an uncle of the
lady Leo Tolstoy subsequently married].</p>

<p class="i2">In this life Mítenka remained the same serious religious
man he was in everything. He ransomed from the brothel a
prostitute named Másha, who was the first woman he knew,
and took her into his house. But this life did not last long. I
believe it was less the vicious and unhealthy life he led for
some months in Moscow, than his mental struggle and his
qualms of conscience, that suddenly destroyed his powerful
organism. He became consumptive, went to the country, was
doctored in the provincial town, and took to his bed in Orél,
where I saw him for the last time just after the Crimean war.
He was in a dreadful state of emaciation: one could even see
how his enormous hand joined on to the two bones of his
lower arm; his face was all eyes, and they were still the same
beautiful serious eyes, with a penetrating expression of inquiry
in them. He was constantly coughing and spitting, but was
loth to die, and reluctant to believe he was dying. Poor pockmarked
Másha, whom he had rescued, was with him and nursed
him. In my presence, at his own wish, a wonder-working icon
was brought. I remember the expression of his face when he
prayed to it.... He died a few days later!</p>

<p>Students of the didactic writings of Tolstoy's later
years will notice how closely his injunctions to a man to
keep to the first woman, whoever she be, with whom he
has had intimate relations, correspond with the line
actually followed by his brother Demetrius.</p>

<p>When Tolstoy left the University, however, these things
were still unthought of. Let us, before returning to the
events of his own life at that time, notice some books which
he read between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one.
They included:</p>

<p>The Sermon on the Mount from St. Matthew's Gospel,</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Rousseau's <i>Confession</i> and <i>Émile</i>, and<br />
Dickens's <i>David Copperfield</i>,</p>

<p>which all had an 'immense' influence on him.</p>

<p>In another category came works which he says had
'very great' influence. These were:</p>

<p class="i2">Rousseau's <i>Nouvelle Héloïse</i>,<br />
Sterne's <i>Sentimental Journey</i>,<br />
Poúshkin's <i>Eugene Onégin</i>,<br />
Schiller's <i>The Robbers</i>,<br />
Gógol's <i>Dead Souls</i>,<br />
Tourgénef's <i>A Sportsman's Sketches</i>,<br />
Drouzhínin's <i>Pólenka Sax</i>,<br />
Grigoróvitch's <i>Antón Goremýka</i>, and the chapter <i>Tamán</i> from Lérmontof's <i>A Hero of Our Times</i>.</p>

<p>In a third category he mentions some of Gógol's
Shorter Stories, and Prescott's <i>Conquest of Mexico</i>, as
having had 'great' influence.</p>

<p>In these works one finds many ideas which have been
congenial to Tolstoy throughout his life, and his adhesion
to which has only become firmer with age. In illustration
of this, take a couple of passages from Dickens which
many readers may have passed without much attention,
but which to Tolstoy represented the absolute truth of
the matters they touch on. David Copperfield says of
Parliament:</p>

<p class="i2">...I considered myself reasonably entitled to escape from
the dreary debates. One joyful night, therefore, I noted down
the music of the parliamentary bagpipes for the last time, and
I have never heard it since; though I still recognise the old
drone in the newspapers without any substantial variation
(except, perhaps, that there is more of it) all the livelong
session.</p>

<p>To most Englishmen with memories of Pym and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Hampden, or personal knowledge of the lives of men who
have devoted themselves disinterestedly to public affairs,
Parliamentary or local, Dickens's sneer at Parliament seems
but a paradox or a joke; but to Tolstoy, with his inherited
dislike of Government, this testimony from a great
English writer (who had served as a Parliamentary reporter)
seemed irrefutable evidence of the futility of Parliaments.</p>

<p>Take, again, a passage in which Dickens hits a nail
adroitly on the head:</p>

<p class="i2">Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words,
which, however ludicrously displayed in his case, was, I must
say, not at all peculiar to him. I have observed it, in the
course of my life, in numbers of men. It seems to me to
be a general rule. In the taking of legal oaths, for instance,
deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come
to several grand words in succession, for the expression of one
idea&mdash;as, that they utterly detest, abominate, and abjure, and
so forth&mdash;and the old anathemas were made relishing on the
same principle. We talk about the tyranny of words, but we
like to tyrannise over them too. We are fond of having a large
superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great
occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds well. As
we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on
State occasions, if they be but fine and numerous enough, so
the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration,
if there be but a great parade of them.</p>

<p>No modern writer has ever more carefully eschewed the
practice Dickens here attacks than Tolstoy has done throughout
his career. Indeed, he is far stricter than Dickens
in this respect.</p>

<p>But much more important than the influence of Dickens
was that of Rousseau, of whom Tolstoy once remarked:</p>

<p class="i2">I have read the whole of Rousseau&mdash;all his twenty volumes,
including his <i>Dictionary of Music</i>. I was more than enthusiastic
about him, I worshipped him. At the age of fifteen I wore a
medallion portrait of him next my body instead of the Orthodox
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
cross. Many of his pages are so akin to me that it seems to
me that I must have written them myself.</p>

<p>Another writer who influenced Tolstoy, though to a
very much smaller extent, was Voltaire, of whom he says:</p>

<p class="i2">I also remember that I read Voltaire when I was very young,
and his ridicule (of religion) not only did not shock me, but
amused me very much.</p>

<p>Everything Tolstoy has done in his life he has done with
intensity; and that this applies to the way in which he
read books in his youth, is shown by the fact that we find
him as an old man, in 1898, in <i>What is Art?</i> according
the highest praise to books he had read before he was
twenty-one, or even before he was fourteen.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1847 that Tolstoy, who was
not yet nineteen, returned to his estate of Yásnaya
Polyána, to live with his dear Aunty Tatiána; to 'perfect'
himself, to study, to manage his estate, and to improve
the condition of his serfs. The last part of this programme,
at any rate, was not destined to have much
success. Though one must never treat Tolstoy's fiction as
strictly autobiographical, yet <i>A Squire's Morning</i> gives a
very fair idea of his own efforts to improve the lot of his
serfs, and of the difficulties and failures he encountered
in the course of that attempt. In that story Prince
Nehlúdof decides to leave the University and settle in the
country, and writes to his aunt:</p>

<p class="i2">As I already wrote you, I found affairs in indescribable disorder.
Wishing to put them right, I discovered that the chief
evil is the truly pitiable, wretched condition of the serfs, and
this is an evil that can only be remedied by work and patience.
If you could but see two of my serfs, David and Iván, and the
life they and their families lead, I am sure the sight of these
two poor wretches would convince you more than all I can say
in explanation of my intention.</p>

<p class="i2">Is it not my plain and sacred duty to care for the welfare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
these seven hundred people for whom I must account to God?
Will it not be a sin if, following plans of pleasure or ambition,
I abandon them to the caprice of coarse Elders and stewards?
And why should I seek in any other sphere opportunities of
being useful and doing good, when I have before me such a
noble brilliant and intimate duty?</p>

<p>Not only is this letter just such as Tolstoy himself
may have written, but the difficulties Nehlúdof encounters
when he tries to move his peasants from the ruts
to which generations of serfdom had accustomed them, are
just those Tolstoy himself met with: the suspicion shown
by the serfs towards any fresh interference on the part of
the master, and the fact that ways to which a community
have grown accustomed are not easily changed by the
sudden effort of a well-intentioned but inexperienced
proprietor.</p>

<p>After spending the summer of 1847 at Yásnaya, Tolstoy
went to Petersburg, where we find him settled in autumn;
and early next year he entered for examination at the
University of that city.</p>


<h3>1848</h3>

<p>On the 13th of the following February he wrote to his
brother Sergius:</p>

<p class="i2">I write you this letter from Petersburg, where I intend to
remain <i>for ever</i>.... I have decided to stay here for my
examinations and then to enter the service....</p>

<p class="i2">In brief, I must say that Petersburg life has a great and
food influence on me: it accustoms me to activity and supplies
the place of a fixed table of occupations. Somehow one
cannot be idle; every one is occupied and active; one cannot
find a man with whom one could lead an aimless life, and one
can't do it alone....</p>

<p class="i2">I know you will not believe that I have changed, but will
say, 'It's already the twentieth time, and nothing comes of
you&mdash;the emptiest of fellows.' No, I have now altered in
quite a new way. I used to say to myself: 'Now I will
change,' but at last I see that I <i>have</i> changed, and I say, 'I
have changed.'</p>

<p class="i2">Above all, I am now quite convinced that one cannot live
by theorising and philosophising, but must live positively, <i>i.e.</i>
must be a practical man. That is a great step in advance and
a great change; it never happened to me before. If one is
young and wishes to live, there is no place in Russia but Petersburg
for it....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p048"><img src="images/p048.jpg" width="450"

<div class="caption">
 <span class="smcap">Tolstoy in 1848, after he had left the University.</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
On the 1st of May he wrote again to his brother, in a
very different strain:</p>

<p class="i2">Seryózha! I think you already say I am 'the emptiest of
fellows,' and it is true. God knows what I have done! I came
to Petersburg without any reason, and have done nothing useful
here, but have spent heaps of money and got into debt.
Stupid! Insufferably stupid! You can't believe how it
torments me. Above all, the <i>debts</i>, which I <i>must</i> pay <i>as soon as
possible</i>, because if I don't pay them soon, besides losing the
money, I shall lose my reputation.... I know you will cry
out; but what's to be done? One commits such folly once
in a lifetime. I have had to pay for my freedom (there was
no one to thrash me, that was my chief misfortune) and for
philosophising, and now I have paid for it. Be so kind as to
arrange to get me out of this false and horrid position&mdash;penniless
and in debt all round.</p>

<p>He goes on to mention that he had passed two examinations
at the University, but that he had altered his mind,
and now, instead of completing his examinations, wanted
to 'enter the Horse Guards as a Junker.' (A Junker was
a young man who volunteered for the army as a Cadet.
Before receiving a commission, a Junker lived with the
officers, while preparing to become one of them.)</p>


<p class="i2">God willing, I will amend and become a steady man at last,
I hope much from my service as a Junker, which will train me
to practical life, and <i>nolens-volens</i> I shall have to earn the rank
of officer. With luck, <i>i.e.</i> if the Guards go into action, I may
get a commission even before the usual two years are up. The
Guards start for the front at the end of May. At present I
can do nothing: first, because I have no money (of which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
shall not need much, I fancy), and secondly, because my two
birth-certificates are at Yásnaya. Have them sent on as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>Before long, Tolstoy was again writing to his brother:</p>

<p class="i2">In my last letter I wrote much nonsense, of which the chief
item was that I intended to enter the Horse Guards; I shall
act on that plan only in case I fail in my examinations, and if
the war is a serious one.</p>

<p>The war in question was Russia's share in quelling the
Hungarian rebellion of 1849. Not a thought of the justice
or otherwise of the cause seems at that time to have
crossed the mind of him who in later life became so powerful
an indicter of war.</p>

<p>This is Tolstoy's own summary, written many years
later, of the period we are now dealing with:</p>

<p class="i2">It was very pleasant living in the country with Aunty
Tatiána, but an indefinite thirst for knowledge drew me away
to a distance. This was in 1848, and I was still uncertain
what to undertake. In Petersburg two roads were open to
me. I could either enter the army, to take part in the
Hungarian campaign, or I could complete my studies at the
University, to enter the Civil Service. My thirst for knowledge
conquered my ambition, and I again began to study. I even
passed two examinations in Law, but then all my good resolutions
broke down. Spring came, and the charm of country life
again drew me back to my estate.</p>

<p>Of the two examinations he passed at this time he
says:</p>

<p class="i2">In 1848 I went to pass the examinations for my degree at
Petersburg University, knowing literally nothing, and reading
up during only one week. I worked day and night; and
passed with Honours in Civil and Criminal Law.</p>

<p>But in spite of this success he did not take the remaining
examinations, and returned to Yásnaya without having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
obtained a degree&mdash;finally abandoning the attempt to
do so.</p>

<p>In later times, when Tolstoy's reputation was world-wide,
critics often amused themselves by detecting inconsistencies
in his conduct and questioning his sincerity.
But the proof of his sincerity is writ large in the story of
his life. Time after time, from the earliest pages of his
Diary, we find him vehemently resolving never more to do
certain things, but always to do other things, and again
and again confessing in the greatest tribulation, that he
had failed to carry out his intentions; yet in spite of
everything he returns, and again returns, to his earliest
ideals and gradually shapes his life into accord with them,
and eventually forms habits which, when he first extolled
them, appeared utterly beyond his reach. Not insincerity
but impetuosity, retrieved by extraordinary tenacity of
purpose, has always characterised him. It was the same
with his thirst for knowledge as with his yet deeper thirst
after righteousness. Often as he was swayed by the lures of
life, each of those two great desires found its satisfaction
at last.</p>

<p>The letters quoted above show some consciousness of
the fact that there is a practical side to life not to be
mastered by theorising; but the duty of learning by experience
as well as by ratiocination is one Tolstoy has
very seldom dwelt on, and never, I think, realised at all
fully.</p>

<p>Another characteristic matter alluded to in these letters
is the difficulty he found himself in for lack of his birth-certificates
and other papers. Russia has long suffered
from a superabundance of red tape, which contrasts
strongly with the slipshod habits of its people, and promotes
the hatred of officialism that is there so common.
The fact that Tolstoy has on several occasions been put to
great inconvenience for lack of certificates, which it was
not in his nature methodically to keep in readiness, is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
small matter, but it has probably had its share in increasing
his strong dislike of governments.</p>

<p>From Petersburg he brought back with him to Yásnaya
a gifted but drunken German musician named Rudolph,
with whom he had chanced to make acquaintance, and
whose talent he had discerned. For some time Tolstoy
devoted himself passionately to music, acquiring sufficient
skill on the piano to become an excellent and sympathetic
accompanist. He was always very susceptible to the influence
of music, and in music, as in literature, he had
strong sympathies and antipathies. Rudolph supplies the
principal figure in Tolstoy's story <i>Albert</i>, written several
years later.</p>

<p>Aunt Tatiána, who had played the piano excellently in
youth, but had quite given it up for nearly thirty years,
and who was now fifty-three years of age, resumed its
practice and, Tolstoy tells us, played duets with him, and
often surprised him by the accuracy and beauty of her
execution.</p>

<p>For the next three years he lived partly at Yásnaya and
partly in Moscow, and led a life alternating between the
asceticism of his brother Demetrius and the self-indulgence
of his brother Sergius; with dissipation, hunting, gambling,
and the society of gipsy-girl singers. These were
among the wildest and most wasted years of his life; but
even here we find him, in the summer of 1850, resuming
his Diary with penitence and self-reproach, and drawing
up a time-table of how his days are in future to be spent:
estate management, bathing, diary-writing, music, dinner,
rest, reading, bathing, and again estate business to close
the day. This curriculum was, however, neglected. Gusts
of passion again swept away his good resolutions.</p>


<h3>1849</h3>

<p>At this time he made his first attempt to start a
school for the peasant children of Yásnaya; but it was
closed again two years later when he was in pecuniary difficulties;
and it was not till 1862 that he discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he had infringed the law by opening it without official
permission.</p>

<p>In relation to women, Tolstoy's ideal was a regular and
affectionate family life. Women were for him divided
into two groups: those sacred ones who could be looked on
as possible wives or sisters, and those who, like the gipsy
singers, could be paid for and possessed for short periods.
To try to wipe out by a money payment any obligation
arising from intimate relations, seems to have been his
fixed rule. His animal passions were very strong, and late
in life I have heard him say that neither drinking, cards,
smoking, nor any other bad habit, had been nearly so hard
for him to overcome as his desire for women. But he
never doubted that that desire was a bad one. To judge
him fairly, it must be remembered how loose was the
general tone of the society in which he lived, and that
the advice given him at this critical time of his life
by those who were his natural guides, was not that he
should live a chaste life, but that he should attach himself
to a woman of good social position. In his <i>Confession</i> he
tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">The kind aunt with whom I lived, herself the purest of
beings, always told me that there was nothing she so desired
for me as that I should have relations with a married woman:
'<i>Rien ne forme un jeune homme, comme une liaison avec une femme
comme il faut</i>' [Nothing so forms a young man, as an intimacy
with a woman of good breeding]. Another happiness she
desired for me was that I should become an aide-de-camp, and if
possible aide-de-camp to the Emperor. But the greatest happiness
of all would be that I should marry a very rich girl and
become possessed of as many serfs as possible.</p>

<p>We never find Tolstoy involved in any family scandal, or
called on to fight a duel about women; but his Diary at
this period contains many traces of his struggles and his
falls; as when he writes:</p>


<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Men whom I consider morally lower than myself, do evil
better than I.... I live an animal life, though not quite
debauched. My occupations are almost all abandoned, and
I am greatly depressed in spirit.</p>

<p>His pecuniary affairs became disordered, owing to his
gambling and other bad habits, and towards the end of
1850 he thought of trying to earn money by taking on a
contract to run the post-station at Toúla, which before
railways were built was an undertaking of some importance.
Varied however as Tolstoy's abilities unquestionably are,
Nature never intended him to be a man of business, and
this plan fortunately came to nothing.</p>


<h3>1850-1851</h3>

<p>The winter of 1850-51 he passed for the most part
in Moscow, and as a foretaste of the simplification of life
which was to be such a prominent feature of his later
years, we find him writing to his aunt at Yásnaya:
'<i>Je dîne à la maison avec des stchi et kasha dont je me contente
parfaitement</i>' [I dine at home on cabbage soup and
buckwheat porridge, with which I am quite contented];
and he goes on to say that he only awaits the preserves and
home-made liqueurs (which she no doubt sent him) to have
everything as he was accustomed to have it in the country.</p>

<p>We find Aunty Tatiána warning him against card-playing.
Tolstoy replies in French:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>Tout ce que vous me dîtes au sujet de la perversité du jeu
est très vrai et me revient souvent à l'esprit. C'est pourquoi
je crois que je ne jouerai plus.... 'Je crois,' mais j'espère
bientôt vous dire pour sûr.</p>


<h3>1851</h3>

<p>In March 1851 he returned to Moscow after visiting
Yásnaya, and he notes in his Diary that he went there
with the treble aim of playing cards, getting married,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and entering the Civil Service. Not one of these three
objects was attained. He took an aversion to cards. For
marriage he considered a conjunction of love, reason,
and fate to be necessary, and none of these was present.
As to entering the service, it was again the fact that
he had not brought the necessary documents with him that
barred the way.</p>

<p>In March he writes to Aunty Tatiána and says he believes
it to be true that spring brings a moral renovation. It
always does him good, and he is able to maintain his good
intentions for some months. Winter is the season that
causes him to go wrong.</p>

<p>Next came a period of religious humility: he fasted
diligently and composed a sermon, which of course was
never preached. He also tried unsuccessfully to write a gipsy
story and an imitation of Sterne's <i>Sentimental Journey</i>.</p>

<p>This period of his life was brought to a close by the
return from the Caucasus, on leave of absence, of his
eldest brother Nicholas, who was by this time an artillery
officer.</p>

<p>Anxious to economise and pay off the debts he had contracted
at cards, especially one of Rs. 4000 to Ogaryóf, a
gendarme officer, who owned a small estate not far from Yásnaya,
Leo resolved to accompany his brother on the latter's
return to the Caucasus. He entrusted his estate to the care
of his brother-in-law (Mary's husband), who was to pay his
debts and allow him only Rs. 500 (then equal to about £80)
a year to live on, and he gave his word not to play cards
any more.</p>

<p>Tolstoy had another reason for wishing to escape from
his accustomed surroundings. His brother Sergius was very
fond of the gipsy choirs, famous in Russia for their musical
talent. These choirs used to visit Yásnaya, and Leo Tolstoy,
who shared his brother's susceptibility to the fascinations
of the gipsy girls, saw a means of safety in flight to the
Caucasus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, let us note the extraordinary
freedom enjoyed by young men of Tolstoy's class in those
days of serfdom. Economically, serfdom supplied them with
means, at the expense of a class deprived of almost all rights
and absolutely dependent on their owners. Even if a member
of the aristocracy ruined himself, family interest or a
prudent marriage often retrieved the position for him.
Religious restraint counted for little, for side by side with
superstition, scepticism was common among the educated.
The standard of morals expected of a young man was
elastic and ill-defined. No irksome sense of public duty
pressed on his attention. Politics, in our sense of the
word, were forbidden; and though he had to enter the
State service (civil or military), this was regarded either
as a way of making a career for himself, or as a mere
formality.</p>

<p>The detachment from the real business of life in which
young Russians grew up, and the comparative isolation in
which they lived on their country estates, explain the
extremely radical conclusions often arrived at by those of
them who wished to make the world better. Chain a man
to the heavily laden car of social progress, and he can only
advance very slowly, though any advance he does accomplish
represents much effort and is of practical importance.
Detach him from that car, and he may easily and pleasantly
fly away on the winds of speculation to the uttermost realm
of the highest heaven, without its producing any immediately
perceptible result on the lives of his fellow-men.
What I mean is, that the less a man is involved in
practical work, the easier and pleasanter it is for him to
take up extreme positions; I do not mean to deny that
activity in the realm of thought and feeling exerts an
unseen yet potent influence on other minds, and ultimately
on practical affairs.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the social surroundings in which Tolstoy
grew up makes it easier to understand the doctrines he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
subsequently taught. It was partly because he grew up in a
detached and irresponsible position that the state of his own
mind and soul were to him so much more important than
the immediate effect of his conduct on others, and the same
cause led him to remain in ignorance of lessons every intelligent
man of business among us learns of necessity.</p>

<p>His independent position made easier the formation of
that state of mind free from intellectual prejudice which
enabled him later on to examine the claims of the Church,
of the Bible, of the economists, of governments, and the most
firmly established manners and customs of society, untrammelled
by the fear of shocking or hurting other people,
though all the time his feelings were so sensitive that it has
never been possible for him to doubt or question the goodness
of those lines of conduct which he had admired and
approved when in childhood he saw them practised by those
near and dear to him.</p>

<p>Contrasting his moral attitude with that of a young
Englishman anxious to do right in our day, I should say
that Tolstoy had no adequate sense of being a responsible
member of a complex community with the opinions and
wishes of which it is necessary to reckon. On the contrary,
his tendency was to recognise with extraordinary vividness
a personal duty revealed by the working of his own conscience
and intellect apart from any systematic study of
the social state of which he was a member.</p>

<p>He thus came to see things in a way we do not see them,
while he remained blind to some things with which we are
quite familiar. That is one reason why he is so extraordinarily
interesting: he puts things in a way no Englishman
would ever dream of putting them, and yet we feel how
near akin we of the Western twentieth-century world are to
this nineteenth-century Russian noble, who has so much in
common with the medieval saint and the Oriental fatalist;
and this helps us to realise that all nations and classes of
men are, indeed, of one blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on, in the sequel to this work, when we have to deal
with Tolstoy's peaceful anarchism and his conviction that
no external regulation of society is necessary, but that all
men would naturally do right were they not hampered by
man-made laws, it will be useful to bear in mind that
his own strength grew through having to steer unaided
through the stormy seas of passion, and from finding his
own way to a haven the lights of which had first shone on
him in childhood. Like the rest of mankind, he judges
others by himself.</p>

<h3>1851</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> brothers Nicholas and Leo left Yásnaya Polyána on
20th April 1851, and spent a couple of weeks in Moscow.
The frankness of Leo's intercourse with his Aunt
Tatiána is illustrated by the following letter which
he wrote, telling her of a visit he paid to Sokólniki, a
pleasant outskirt of Moscow on the borders of a pine
forest, where a fête is held on May-day.</p>

<p>That he wrote in French is explained by the fact that
Tatiána, like many Russian ladies educated early in the
nineteenth century, knew French better than she did
Russian.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>J'ai été à la promenade de Sokólniki par un temps détestable,
c'est pourquoi je n'ai rencontré personne des dames de la
société, que j'avais envie de voir. Comme vous prétendez que
je suis un homme à épreuves, je suis allé parmi les plébs, dans
les tentes bohémiennes. Vous pouvez aisément vous figurer le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
combat intérieur qui s'engagea là-bas pour et contre. Au reste
j'en sortis victorieux, c.à d. n'ayant rien donné que ma bénédiction
aux joyeux descendants des illustres Pharaons. Nicolas
trouve que je suis un compagnon de voyage très agréable, si ce
n'était ma propreté. Il se fâche de ce que, comme il le dit, je
change de linge 12 fois par jour. Moi je le trouve aussi compagnon
très agréable, si ce n'était sa saleté. Je ne sais lequel
de nous a raison.</p>

<p>On leaving Moscow, instead of travelling to the Caucasus
by the usual route <i>viâ</i> Vorónesh, Nicholas Tolstoy, who
liked to do things his own way, decided that they would
drive first to Kazán. Here they stayed a week, visiting acquaintances,
and that was long enough for Leo to fall in
love with a young lady to whom his shyness prevented his
expressing his sentiments. He left for the Caucasus bearing
his secret with him, and we hear no more of the matter.</p>

<p>From Kazán they drove to Sarátof, where they hired
a boat large enough to take their travelling carriage on
board, and with a crew of three men, made their way down
the Vólga to Astrakhán, sometimes rowing, sometimes
sailing, and sometimes drifting with the stream.</p>

<p>The scorn of luxury and social distinctions so prominent
in Tolstoy's later philosophy, was at this period more to
the taste of his brother Nicholas. A gentleman drove
past them in Kazán leaning on his walking-stick with
ungloved hands, and that was sufficient to cause Leo to
speak of him contemptuously, whereupon Nicholas, in his
usual tone of good-natured irony, wanted to know why a
man should be despised for not wearing gloves.</p>

<p>From Astrakhán they had still to drive some two hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>dred
and seventy miles to reach Starogládovsk, where
Nicholas Tolstoy's battery was stationed. The whole
journey from Moscow, including the stay in Kazán, took
nearly a month.</p>

<p>It may be convenient here to explain why the Russians
were then fighting in the Caucasus. Georgia, situated to
the south of the Caucasian Mountains, had been voluntarily
annexed to Russia in 1799 to escape the oppression of
Persia; and it therefore became politically desirable for
Russia to subdue the tribes that separated her from her
newly acquired dependency. During the first half of the
nineteenth century this task proceeded very slowly, but at
the time we are speaking of, Prince Baryatínsky, in command
of the Russian forces stationed on the left bank of
the river Térek, which flows into the Caspian Sea, was
undertaking a series of expeditions against the hostile
native tribes. Up to that time the Russians had held hardly
anything south of the Térek and north of the Caucasian
Mountains, except their own forts and encampments; but
in less than another decade, Baryatínsky had captured
Shámyl (the famous leader who so long defied Russia)
and had subdued the whole country.</p>

<p>Soon after the brothers Tolstoy arrived at Starogládovsk,
Nicholas was ordered to the fortified camp at Goryatchevódsk
('Hot Springs'), an advanced post recently established
to protect the invalids who availed themselves of
those mineral waters.</p>

<p>Here Leo Tolstoy first saw, and was deeply impressed by,
the beauty of the magnificent mountain range which he
has so well described in <i>The Cossacks</i>. In July 1851 he
wrote to his Aunt Tatiána:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>Nicolas est parti dans une semaine après son arrivée, et moi
je l'y suivis, de sorte que nous sommes presque depuis trois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
semaines ici où nous logeons dans une tente. Mais comme le
temps est beau et que je me fais un peu à ce genre de vie, je
me trouve très bien. Ici il y a des coups d'&oelig;il magnifiques, à
commencer par l'endroit où sont les sources. C'est une énorme
montagne de pierres l'une sur l'autre, dont les unes se sont détachées
et forment des espèces de grottes, les autres restent
suspendues à une grande hauteur. Elles sont toutes coupées
par les courants d'eau chaude, qui tombent avec bruit dans
quelques endroits et couvrent surtout le matin toute la partie
élevée de la montagne d'une vapeur blanche qui se détache
continuellement de cette eau bouillante. L'eau est tellement
chaude qu'on cuit dedans les &oelig;ufs <i>hard</i> en trois minutes. Au
milieu de ce ravin sur le torrent principal il y a trois moulins,
l'un au-dessus de l'autre, qui sont construits d'une manière
toute particulière et très pittoresque. Toute la journée les
femmes tartares ne cessent de venir au-dessus et au-dessous de
ces moulins pour laver leur linge. II faut vous dire qu'elles
lavent avec les pieds. C'est comme une fourmilière toujours
remuante. Les femmes sont pour la plupart belles et bien
faites. Les costumes des femmes orientales malgré leur pauvreté,
sont gracieux. Les groupes pittoresques que forment les
femmes, joint à la beauté sauvage de l'endroit fait un coup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
d'&oelig;il véritablement admirable. Je reste très souvent des heures
à admirer ce paysage. Puis le coup d'&oelig;il du haut de la montagne
est encore plus beau et tout à fait dans un autre genre.
Mais je crains de vous ennuyer avec mes descriptions.</p>

<p class="i2">Je suis très content d'être aux eaux puisque j'en profite. Je
prends des bains ferrugineux et je ne sens plus de douleur aux
pieds.</p>

<p>As showing how hot these springs were, it may be
mentioned that a dog belonging to Nicholas tumbled into
the water and was scalded to death.</p>

<p>The officers Tolstoy met, he found to be men without
education, and he wrote: 'At first many things in this
society shocked me, but I have accustomed myself to them,
without however attaching myself to these gentlemen. I
have found a happy mean, in which there is neither pride
nor familiarity.' He was helped by the fact that Nicholas
was popular with every one; and, by adopting the plan of
having vódka, wine, and something to eat always ready for
those who dropped in to see him, he succeeded in keeping
on good terms with these men, though he did not care
to know them intimately.</p>

<p>The following extract from his Diary preserves the
record of the rapidly changing moods he experienced in
those days. Soon after reaching the Caucasus he noted:</p>

<p class="p2 right i2"><span class="smcap">Stary Urt</span>, <i>11th June 1851</i>.</p>

<p class="i2">Yesterday I hardly slept all night. Having posted up my
Diary, I prayed to God. It is impossible to convey the sweetness
of the feeling I experienced during my prayer. I said
the prayers I usually repeat by heart: 'Our Father,' 'To the
Virgin,' etc., and still remained in prayer. If one defines
prayer as a petition or as thanksgiving, then I did not pray.
I desired something supreme and good; but what, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
express, though I was clearly conscious of what I wanted. I
wished to merge into the Universal Being. I asked Him to
pardon my crimes; yet no, I did not ask that, for I felt that
if He had given me this blissful moment, He had pardoned
me. I asked, and at the same time felt that I had nothing to
ask, and that I cannot and do not know how to ask; I thanked
Him, but not with words or thoughts. I combined in one
feeling both petition and gratitude. Fear quite vanished. I
could not have separated any one emotion&mdash;faith, hope or love&mdash;from
the general feeling. No, this was what I experienced
yesterday: it was love of God, lofty love, uniting in itself all
that is good, excluding all that is bad. How dreadful it was
to me to see the trivial and vicious side of life! I could not
understand its having any attraction for me. How I asked God
with a pure heart to accept me into His bosom! I did not feel
the flesh.... But no, the carnal, trivial side again asserted itself,
and before an hour had passed I almost consciously heard the
voice of vice, vanity, and the empty side of life; I knew whence
that voice came, knew it had ruined my bliss! I struggled
against it, and yet yielded to it. I fell asleep thinking of fame
and of women; but it was not my fault, I could not help it.</p>

<p>Again, on 2nd July, after writing down reflections on
suffering and death, he concludes:</p>

<p class="i2">How strong I seem to myself to be against all that can
happen; how firm in the conviction that one must expect
nothing here but death; yet a moment later I am thinking
with pleasure of a saddle I have ordered, on which I shall ride
dressed in a Cossack cloak, and of how I shall carry on with
the Cossack girls; and I fall into despair because my left
moustache is higher than my right, and for two hours I
straighten it out before the looking-glass.</p>

<p>By August he was back again at Starogládovsk, and,
full of energy, risked his life as a volunteer in expeditions
against the Circassians. Having met Ilyá Tolstoy, an
officer and a relation, he was introduced by him to the
Commander-in-Chief, General Baryatínsky. The latter
had noticed Leo Tolstoy during one of the expeditions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and on making his acquaintance complimented him on his
bravery and advised him to enter the army. Ilyá Tolstoy
urged the same advice, and Leo accepted it. Towards the
end of October he went a tiresome but beautiful seven-days'
journey to Tiflis, where he had to pass the examination
qualifying him to become a Junker (Cadet). From
there he wrote to his Aunt Tatiána a letter containing the
first intimation of the vocation that was ultimately to
make him far more famous than Baryatínsky himself:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>Vous rappelez-vous, bonne tante, un conseil que vous
m'avez donné jadis&mdash;celui de faire des romans? Eh bien! je
suis votre conseil et les occupations dont je vous parle consistent
à faire de la littérature. Je ne sais si ce que j'écris
paraîtra jamais dans le monde, mais c'est un travail qui
m'amuse et dans lequel je persévère depuis trop longtemps
pour l'abandonner.</p>

<p>For two months he lived in the 'German' suburb of
Tiflis, paying Rs. 5 a month (at that time equal to about
16s.) for his two-roomed lodging; disturbed by no one,
writing <i>Childhood</i>, and trying to enter the army&mdash;the
main obstacle to which was that, as usual, he found himself
without his birth-certificate and other documents. He
seldom enjoyed good health for many consecutive months,
and during his stay in Tiflis he was confined to the house
for some weeks by illness. At last, on 23rd December
1851, he was able to write to his brother, Sergius, announcing
that in a few days he expected to receive his
appointment as Junker in the 4th battery of artillery,
and that on the day he received it he would set out for
Starogládovsk, and from there go on campaign, and to
the best of his ability 'assist, with the aid of a cannon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in destroying the predatory and turbulent Asiatics.' He
goes on to tell of hunting. He had been out nine times,
and had killed two foxes and about sixty grey hares. He
had also hunted wild boar and deer, but had not killed any.</p>

<p>In the same letter Tolstoy mentions Hádji Mourát, the
hero of a tale he wrote more than fifty years later, and that
has been put aside for posthumous publication. He says:
'If you wish to show off with news from the Caucasus, you
may recount that a certain Hádji Mourát (the second in
importance to Shámyl himself) surrendered a few days ago
to the Russian Government. He was the leading dare-devil
and "brave" in all Circassia, but was led to commit a
mean action.'</p>


<h3>1852</h3>

<p>A little later, on 6th January 1852, we find
him again in Tiflis, writing to Aunt Tatiána.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>Je viens de recevoir votre lettre du 24 Novembre et je
vous y réponds le moment même (comme j'en ai pris l'habitude).
Dernièrement je vous écrivais que votre lettre m'a
fait pleurer et j'accusai ma maladie de cette faiblesse. J'ai eu
tort. Toutes vos lettres me font depuis quelque temps le
même effet. J'ai toujours été <i>Lyóva-ryóva</i> [Leo, Cry-baby].
Avant cette faiblesse me faisait honte, mais les larmes que je
verse en pensant à vous et à votre amour pour nous, sont
tellement douces que je les laisse couler, sans aucune fausse-honte.
Votre lettre est trop pleine de tristesse pour qu'elle ne
produise pas sur moi le même effet. C'est vous qui toujours
m'avez donné des conseils et quoique malheureusement je ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
les aie pas suivis quelquefois, je voudrais toute ma vie n'agir
que d'après vos avis. Permettez-moi pour le moment de vous
dire l'effet qu'a produit sur moi votre lettre et les idées qui me
sont venues en la lisant. Si je vous parle trop franchement je
sais que vous me le pardonnerez en faveur de l'amour que j'ai
pour vous. En disant que c'est votre tour de nous quitter
pour aller rejoindre ceux qui ne sont plus et que vous avez tant
aimés, en disant que vous demandez à Dieu de mettre un terme
à votre existence qui vous semble si insupportable et isolée,&mdash;pardon,
chère tante, mais il me paraît qu'en disant cela vous
offensez Dieu et moi et nous tous qui vous aimons tant. Vous
demandez à Dieu la mort, c. à dire le plus grand malheur qui
puisse m'arriver (ce n'est pas une phrase, mais Dieu m'est
témoin que les deux plus grands malheurs qui puissent m'arriver
ce serait votre mort ou celle de Nicolas&mdash;les deux personnes
que j'aime plus que moi-même). Que resterait-il pour moi si
Dieu exauçait votre prière? Pour faire plaisir à qui, voudrais-je
devenir meilleur, avoir de bonnes qualités, avoir une bonne
réputation dans le monde? Quand je fais des plans de bonheur
pour moi, l'idée que vous partagerez et jouirez de mon bonheur
m'est toujours présente. Quand je fais quelque chose de bon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
je suis content de moi-même, parce que je sais que vous serez
contente de moi. Quand j'agis mal, ce que je crains le plus&mdash;c'est
de vous faire du chagrin. Votre amour est tout pour moi,
et vous demandez à Dieu qu'il nous sépare! Je ne puis vous
dire le sentiment que j'ai pour vous, la parole ne suffit pas pour
vous l'exprimer et je crains que vous ne pensiez que j'exagère
et cependant je pleure à chaudes larmes en vous écrivant.</p>

<p>In the same letter he tells of one of those remarkable
'answers to prayer,' instances of thought-transference, or
(if the reader pleases) simply coincidences, which have
played so great a part in the history of all religious bodies.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>Aujourd'hui il m'est arrivé une de ces choses qui m'auraient
fait croire en Dieu, si je n'y croyais déjà fermement depuis
quelque temps.</p>

<p class="i2">L'été à Stáry Urt tous les officiers qui y étaient ne faisaient
que jouer et assez gros jeu. Comme en vivant au camp il est
impossible de ne pas se voir souvent, j'ai très souvent assisté au
jeu et malgré les instances qu'on me faisait j'ai tenu bon
pendant un mois; mais un beau jour en plaisantant, j'ai mis un
petit enjeu, j'ai perdu, j'ai recommencé, j'ai encore perdu, la
chance en était mauvaise, la passion du jeu s'est reveillée et en
deux jours j'ai perdu tout ce que j'avais d'argent et celui que
Nicolas m'a donné (à peu près 250 r. argent) et par dessus cela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
encore 500 r. argent pour lequel j'ai donné une lettre de change
payable au mois de Janvier 1852.</p>

<p class="i2">Il faut vous dire que près du camp il y a un <i>Aoul</i> qu'habitent
les Tchitchéniens. Un jeune garçon (Tchitchénien) Sado
venait au camp et jouait, mais comme il ne savait pas compter
et inscrire il y avait des chenapans qui le trichaient. Je n'ai
jamais voulu jouer pour cette raison contre Sado, et même je
lui ai dit qu'il ne fallait pas qu'il jouât, parce qu'on le trompait
et je me suis proposé de jouer pour lui par procuration. Il m'a
été très reconnaissant pour ceci et m'a fait cadeau d'une bourse.
Comme c'est l'usage de cette nation de se faire des cadeaux
mutuels, je lui ai donné un misérable fusil que j'avais acheté
pour 8 rb. Il faut vous dire que pour devenir <i>Kounák</i>, ce qui
veut dire ami, il est d'usage de se faire des cadeaux, et puis de
manger dans la maison du <i>Kounák</i>. Après cela, d'après l'ancien
usage de ces peuples (qui n'existe presque plus que par tradition)
on devient ami à la vie et à la mort, c.à d. que si je lui
demande tout son argent, ou sa femme, ou ses armes, ou tout
ce qu'il a de plus précieux, il doit me les donner, et moi aussi
je ne dois rien lui refuser. Sado m'a engagé de venir chez lui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
et d'être <i>Kounák</i>. J'y suis allé. Après m'avoir régalé à leur
manière, il m'a proposé de choisir dans sa maison tout ce que je
voudrais&mdash;ses armes, son cheval ... tout. J'ai voulu choisir
ce qu'il y avait de moins cher et j'ai pris une bride de cheval
montée en argent, mais il m'a dit que je l'offensais et m'a
obligé de prendre une <i>sword</i> qui vaut au moins 100 r. arg.</p>

<p class="i2">Son père est un homme assez riche, mais qui a son argent
enterré et ne donne pas le sou à son fils. Le fils pour avoir de
l'argent va voler chez l'ennemi des chevaux, des vaches; quelquefois
il expose 20 fois sa vie pour voler une chose qui ne vaut
pas 10 r., mais ce n'est pas par cupidité qu'il le fait, mais par
genre. Le plus grand voleur est très estimé et on l'appelle
'<i>Dzhigit</i>,' un <i>Brave</i>. Tantôt Sado a 1000 r. arg., tantôt pas le
sou. Après une visite chez lui, je lui ai fait cadeau de la
montre d'argent de Nicolas et nous sommes devenus les plus
grands amis du monde. Plusieurs fois il m'a prouvé son
dévouement en s'exposant à des dangers pour moi, mais
ceci pour lui n'est rien&mdash;c'est devenu une habitude et un
plaisir.</p>

<p class="i2">Quand je suis parti de Stáry Urt et que Nicolas y est resté,
Sado venait chez lui tous les jours et disait qu'il ne savait que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
devenir sans moi et qu'il s'ennuyait terriblement. Par une
lettre je faisais connaître à Nicolas, que mon cheval étant
malade, je le priais de m'en trouver un à Stáry Urt; Sado
ayant appris cela n'eut rien de plus pressé que de venir chez
moi et de me donner son cheval, malgré tout ce que j'ai pu
faire pour refuser.</p>

<p class="i2">Après la bêtise que j'ai fait de jouer à Stáry Urt, je n'ai plus
repris les cartes en mains, et je faisais continuellement la
morale à Sado qui a la passion du jeu et quoiqu'il ne connaisse
pas le jeu, a toujours un bonheur étonnant. Hier soir je me suis
occupé à penser à mes affaires pécuniaires, à mes dettes; je
pensais comment je ferais pour les payer. Ayant longtemps
pensé à ces choses, j'ai vu que si je ne dépense pas trop d'argent,
toutes mes dettes ne m'embarrasseront pas et pourront petit à
petit être payées dans 2 ou 3 ans; mais les 500 rbs., que je
devais payer ce mois, me mettaient au désespoir. Il m'était
impossible de les payer et pour le moment ils m'embarrassaient
beaucoup plus que ne l'avaient fait autrefois les 4000 d'Ogaryéff.
Cette bêtise d'avoir fait les dettes que j'avais en Russie et de
venir en faire de nouvelles ici me mettait au désespoir. Le
soir en faisant ma prière, j'ai prié Dieu qu'il me tire de cette
désagréable position et avec beaucoup de ferveur. 'Mais com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ment
est-ce que je puis me tirer de cette affaire?' pensai-je en
me couchant. 'Il ne peut rien arriver qui me donne la possibilité
d'acquitter cette dette.' Je me représentais déjà tous
les désagréments que j'avais à essuyer à cause de cela: how
when he presents the note for collection, the authorities will
demand an explanation as to why I did not pay, etc. 'Lord,
help me!' said I, and fell asleep.</p>

<p class="i2">Le lendemain je reçois une lettre de Nicolas à laquelle était
jointe la votre et plusieurs autres&mdash;il m'écrit:</p>

<p class="i2">The other day Sádo came to see me. He has won your notes-of-hand
from Knorring, and has brought them to me. He was
so pleased to have won them, and asked me so often, 'What do
you think? Will your brother be glad that I have done this?'
that I have grown very fond of him. That man is really
attached to you.</p>

<p class="i2">N'est-ce pas étonnant que de voir ses v&oelig;ux aussi exaucés
le lendemain même? C. à d., qu'il n'y a rien d'aussi étonnant
que la bonté divine pour un être qui la mérite si peu que moi.
Et n'est-ce pas que le trait de dévouement de Sado est admirable?
Il sait que j'ai un frère Serge, qui aime les chevaux et
comme je lui ai promis de le prendre en Russie quand j'y irai, il
m'a dit, que dût-il lui en coûter 100 fois la vie, il volera le
meilleur cheval qu'il y ait dans les montagnes, et qu'il le lui
amènera.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Faites, je vous prie, acheter à Toúla un <i>6-barrelled pistol</i> et
un <i>musical-box</i>, si cela ne coûte pas trop cher. Ce sont des
choses qui lui feront beaucoup de plaisir.</p>

<p>In explanation of this letter one has to mention that
Sádo was a 'peaceful' Circassian, that is, one friendly
to Russia (though his tribe in general were hostile), and
further, that the passages printed in English in the midst
of the French text, are in the original written in Russian.</p>

<p>A few days later we find Tolstoy on his way back to
Starogládovsk, stopping (probably for post-horses) at the
post-station Mozdók, and again writing his aunt a long
letter in which he says:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>La religion et l'expérience que j'ai de la vie (quelque
petite qu'elle soit) m'ont appris que la vie est une épreuve.
Dans moi elle est plus qu'une épreuve, c'est encore l'expiation
de mes fautes.</p>

<p class="i2">J'ai dans l'idée que l'idée si frivole que j'ai eu d'aller faire un
voyage au Caucase&mdash;est une idée qui m'a été inspirée d'en haut.
C'est la main de Dieu qui m'a guidé&mdash;je ne cesse de l'en remercier.
Je sens que je suis devenu meilleur ici (et ce n'est
pas beaucoup dire puisque j'ai été très mauvais) et je suis
fermement persuadé que tout ce qui peut m'arriver ici ne sera
que pour mon bien, puisque c'est Dieu lui-même qui l'a voulu
ainsi. Peut-être c'est une idée bien hardie, néanmoins j'ai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cette conviction. C'est pour cela que je supporte les fatigues
et les privations physiques dont je parle (ce ne sont pas des
privations physiques&mdash;il n'y en a pas pour un garçon de 23
ans qui se porte bien) sans les ressentir, même avec une espèce
de plaisir en pensant au bonheur qui m'attend.</p>

<p class="i2">Voilà comment je le représente:</p>

<p class="i2">Après un nombre indéterminé d'années, ni jeune, ni vieux,
je suis à Yásnaya; mes affaires sont en ordre, je n'ai pas d'inquiétudes,
ni de tracasseries. Vous habitez Yásnaya aussi.
Vous avez un peu vieillie, mais êtes encore fraîche et bien portante.
Nous menons la vie que nous avons menée,&mdash;je travaille
le matin, mais nous nous voyons presque toute la journée.
Nous dînons. Le soir je fais une lecture qui ne vous ennuie
pas, puis nous causons&mdash;moi je vous raconte ma vie au Caucase,
vous me parlez de vos souvenirs&mdash;de mon père, de ma mère,
vous me contez des '<i>terrible tales</i>' que jadis nous écoutions les
yeux effrayés et la bouche béante. Nous nous rappelons les
personnes qui nous ont été chères et qui ne sont plus; vous
pleurerez, j'en ferai de même, mais ces larmes seront douces;
nous causerons des frères qui viendront nous voir de temps en
temps, de la chère Marie qui passera aussi quelques mois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
de l'année a Yásnaya qu'elle aime tant, avec tous ses enfants.
Nous n'aurons point de connaissances&mdash;personne ne viendra
nous ennuyer et faire des commérages. C'est un beau rêve,
mais ce n'est pas encore tout ce que je me permets de rêver.&mdash;Je
suis marié&mdash;ma femme est une personne douce, bonne,
aimante; elle a pour vous le même amour que moi; nous avons
des enfants qui vous appellent grandmaman; vous habitez la
grande maison en haut, la même chambre que jadis habitait
grandmaman. Toute la maison est dans le même ordre qu'elle
a été du temps de papa et nous recommençons la même vie,
seulement en changéant de rôle; vous prenez le rôle de grandmaman,
mais vous êtes encore meilleure; moi le rôle de papa,
mais je désespère de jamais le mériter; ma femme celui de
maman, les enfants le nôtre; Marie le rôle des deux tantes,
leurs malheurs exceptés.... Mais il manquera un personnage
pour prendre le rôle que vous avez joué dans notre famille;
jamais il ne se trouvera une âme aussi belle, aussi aimante que la
vôtre. Vous n'avez pas de successeur. Il y aura trois nouveaux
personnages, qui paraîtront de temps en temps sur la scène&mdash;les
frères, surtout l'un qui sera souvent avec nous: Nicolas&mdash;vieux
garçon, chauve, retiré du service, toujours aussi bon, aussi
noble.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I imagine how he will, as of old, tell the children fairy tales
of his own invention, and how they will kiss his greasy hands
(but which are worthy of it), how he will play with them, how
my wife will bustle about to get him his favourite dishes, how
he and I will recall our common memories of days long past,
how you will sit in your accustomed place and listen to us with
pleasure; how, as of yore, you will call us, old men, 'Lyóvotchka'
and 'Nikólenka,' and will scold me for eating with
my fingers, and him for not having clean hands.</p>

<p class="i2">Si on me faisait empereur de Russie, si on me donnait le
Pérou, en un mot si une fée venait avec sa baguette me
demander ce que je désire&mdash;la main sur la conscience, je répondrais
que je désire seulement que ce rêve puisse devenir une
réalité.</p>

<p>He returned to Starogládovsk a Junker, and in February
took part in an expedition as a non-commissioned artillery
officer, and nearly received a St. George's Cross for bravery,
but lost it because, once again, he had not his documents
in order.</p>

<p>Writing to his Aunt Tatiána some months later (June
1852), he says:</p>


<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>Pendant cette expédition, j'ai eu l'occasion d'être deux
fois présenté à la croix de St. Georges et je n'ai pas pu la
recevoir à cause du retard de quelques jours de ce maudit
papier. J'ai été présenté pour la journée du 18 Février (ma
fête), mais on a été obligé de refuser à cause du manque de ce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
papier. La liste des présentations partit le 19, le 20 le papier
était arrivé. Je vous avoue franchement que de tous les honneurs
militaires c'est cette seule petite croix que j'ai eu la
vanité d'ambitionner.</p>

<p>On a second occasion he had the refusal of the coveted
cross, but his Colonel pointed out to him that besides
being sometimes given to Junkers favoured by their officers,
these crosses were also, and more usually, granted to old
and deserving privates, whom they entitled to a life pension;
and that if Tolstoy would forego the one intended
for him, it would be given to a veteran who deserved it,
and to whom it would secure a subsistence for his old age.
Tolstoy, to his honour be it said, renounced the coveted
decoration. He had a third chance of securing it later on,
but this time, absorbed in playing chess till late at night,
he omitted to go on duty, and the Commander of the
Division noticing his absence, placed him under arrest
and cancelled the award which had been already made
in his favour. Chess, I may here mention, has always
been a favourite game of Tolstoy's. He has never
studied the game from books, but has played much and
plays ingeniously and well.</p>

<p>The kind of warfare in which he was now engaged, is
well described in <i>The Raid</i> and <i>The Wood-Felling</i>. A
detachment would set out to seize a Tartar village, make
a clearing in a forest, or capture cattle. It would exchange
cannon- and rifle-shots with Tartar skirmishers, and
would lose perhaps half a dozen men killed or wounded
before accomplishing its object; but the more serious part
of the work came when the expedition returned to the
fortified camp from which it had started. As soon as
the retreat commenced, Tartar sharpshooters would swarm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
out, trying to cut off stragglers and inflicting as much
damage as possible. Even after the Russians were beyond
rifle-shot, a chance ball from a Tartar cannon might reach
them within sight of their own quarters.</p>

<p>To see a single man one has known well, struck down
by a deadly bullet, may impress an observer as vividly
as the myriad corpses of a great battlefield; and in
Tolstoy's earliest war-sketches one feels the note of horror
at war quite as strongly as when, later on, he described
far bloodier struggles at Sevastopol.</p>

<p>When not on campaign, Tolstoy was generally stationed
at the Cossack village of Starogládovsk, where he lived
more or less the life vividly described in <i>The Cossacks</i>.
The Grebénsky Cossacks located there were descended from
Russian Dissenters (Old-Believers) who had fled from the
persecution of former Tsars and had settled among the
Mohammedan Circassians near the river Térek. They
had retained the purity of their Russian speech, and remained
nominally Christians, but had intermarried with
the natives and adopted many of their manners and
customs. Love of freedom, idleness, robbery, hunting,
and war were their most prominent characteristics. They
considered themselves altogether superior both to the semi-savage
Mohammedan natives and to the tame, disciplined
Russians. Drunkenness was not so much a weakness of
these men as 'a tribal rite, to abandon which would have
been considered as an act of apostasy.' The work was
done by the women, or by hired Nogai-Tartar labourers.
The women were physically better developed than the men,
and were celebrated for their beauty, combining the purest
type of Circassian features with the powerful build of
Northern women. In their relations with men, especially
before marriage, they enjoyed absolute freedom.</p>

<p>There was much that attracted Tolstoy in the simple
life of these people: their frankness, their skill in hunting,
their contempt for all that is artificial or weak, and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
freedom from the moral struggles that tormented him.
With one beautiful girl&mdash;Mariána&mdash;he fell deeply in love,
but she remained indifferent to the attentions of a man who
was inferior in the arts of war and hunting to some of the
young men of her own tribe. His courtship failed (as he
says of his hero in <i>The Cossacks</i>) because he could not,
like a dashing young Cossack, 'steal herds, get drunk on
Tchikir wine, troll songs, kill people, and when tipsy climb
in at her window for a night, without thinking who he was
or why he existed.'</p>

<p>Though one has always to be carefully on one's guard
against taking Tolstoy's stories as though they were autobiographical,
there are passages in <i>The Cossacks</i> which
certainly apply to himself, and give a vivid idea of some
of his moods at this time, as well as of his way of life
while living as a Junker at Starogládovsk.</p>

<p>On one occasion the hero is out hunting in the woods
and asks himself:</p>

<p class="i2">'How must I live so as to be happy, and why was I formerly
not happy?' And he remembered his previous life, and felt
disgusted with himself.... And suddenly a new light seemed
revealed to him. 'Happiness,' said he to himself, 'consists in
living for others. That is clear. The demand for happiness is
innate in man; therefore it is legitimate. If we seek to satisfy
it selfishly: by seeking wealth, fame, comforts, or love, circumstances
may render the satisfaction of these desires impossible.
It follows that they are illegitimate, but not that the demand
for happiness itself is illegitimate. But what desire is there
that can always be satisfied in spite of external conditions?
What desire? Love, self-sacrifice!' He was so glad and
excited at discovering this, as it seemed to him, new truth,
that he jumped up and began impatiently seeking for some one
for whom he might quickly sacrifice himself: to whom he
might do good, and whom he could love. 'Yes; I need
nothing for myself!' he kept mentally repeating: 'Then why
not live for others?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
In the same story Tolstoy tells us that his hero lived
monotonously and regularly.</p>

<p class="i2">He had little to do with his Commander or fellow-officers.
In the Caucasus the position of a Junker with means of his
own was in this respect particularly favourable. He was not
sent to drill nor kept at work. As a reward for going on an
expedition he was recommended for a commission, and meanwhile
he was left alone. The officers considered him an
aristocrat, and therefore in their intercourse with him bore
themselves with dignity. Card-playing and the officers'
carousals with singers, of which he had had experience when
on service with the detachment, seemed to him unattractive,
and he avoided the officers' society.</p>

<p>Again he tells us that his hero</p>

<p class="i2">often thought seriously of abandoning all else, enrolling himself
as a Cossack, buying a cottage, and marrying a Cossack
girl ... and living with Uncle Eróshka, going with him to
hunt and to fish, and with the Cossacks on expeditions. 'Why
don't I do this? What am I waiting for?' he asked himself....
But a voice told him to wait, and not to decide. He
was restrained by a dim consciousness that he could not fully
live the life of Eróshka and Loukáshka, because he had another
happiness,&mdash;he was restrained by the thought that happiness
lies in self-sacrifice.... He continually sought an opportunity
to sacrifice himself for others, but it did not present itself.</p>

<p>In the same story the Cossack Loukáshka kills a Tartar
'brave' at night, and rises greatly in the popular esteem
and in his own; and the hero thinks to himself:</p>

<p class="i2">'What nonsense and confusion! A man kills another and
is as happy and satisfied as though he had done an excellent
deed. Does nothing tell him there is here no cause for great
rejoicing? That happiness consists not in killing others, but
in sacrificing oneself?'</p>

<p>We have a yet safer record of Tolstoy's feelings in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Diary, in which about this time he noted down the following
reflections concerning the chief faults he was conscious
of in himself:</p>

<p class="i2">1. The passion of gaming is a covetous passion, gradually
developing into a craving for strong excitement. Against this
passion one can struggle.</p>

<p class="i2">2. Sensuality is a physical need, a demand of the body,
excited by imagination. It increases with abstinence, and
therefore the struggle against it is very difficult. The best way
is by labour and occupation.</p>

<p class="i2">3. Vanity is the passion least harmful to others and most
harmful to oneself.</p>

<p>In another passage, indicating quite a different phase of
consciousness, he writes:</p>

<p class="i2">For some time past repentance for the loss of the best years
of life has begun to torment me, and this since I commenced
to feel that I could do something good.... There is something
in me which compels me to believe that I was not born
to be like everybody else.</p>

<p>In May we find him going on furlough to Pyatigórsk
to drink the mineral water and to be treated for rheumatism.
This is his description of Pyatigórsk, written
nearly twenty years later in his Reading Book for Children:</p>

<p class="i2">Pyatigórsk (Five Hills) is so called because it stands on
Mount Besh-tau. <i>Besh</i> means in Tartar 'five,' <i>Tau</i> means
'hill.' From this mountain flows a hot sulphur stream. The
water is boiling, and over the places where it springs from the
mountain there is always steam, as from a samovár.</p>

<p class="i2">The whole place where the town stands is very gay. From
the mountain flow hot springs, and at the foot of the mountain
flows the river Podkoúmok. The mountain slopes are wooded,
all around are fields, and afar off one sees the great Caucasian
mountains. On these the snow never melts, and they are
always as white as sugar. When the weather is clear, wherever
one goes one sees the great mountain, Elbrus, like a sugar
cone. People come to the hot springs for their health; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
over the springs, arbours and awnings have been erected, and
gardens and paths have been laid out all around. In the
morning a band plays, and people drink the waters, or bathe,
or stroll about.</p>

<p>Here he was joined by his sister Mary and her husband.
She also came to Pyatigórsk to be cured of rheumatism.
She tells how her brother Leo was at this time attracted
by Spiritualism, and would sometimes even borrow a table
from a <i>café</i> and have a <i>séance</i> on the boulevard. He
remained in Pyatigórsk till 5th August, and then returned
to Starogládovsk. From thence he wrote to his aunt,
repeating what he had said before of the officers with whom
he had to associate.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>Il y a une trop grande différence dans l'éducation, les
sentiments et la manière de voir de ceux que je rencontre ici
pour que je trouve quelque plaisir avec eux. Il n'y a que
Nicolas qui a le talent, malgré l'énorme différence qu'il y a
entre lui et tous ces messieurs, à s'amuser avec eux et à être
aimé de tous. Je lui envie ce talent, mais je sens que je ne
puis en faire autant.</p>

<p>He mentions that for some time past he has acquired a
taste for reading history, and says that he perseveres in his
literary occupations. He had already three times rewritten
a work he had in hand, and intended to rewrite it again.
He felt much more content with himself at this time, and
adds:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>Il y a eu un temps où j'étais vain de mon esprit et de ma
position dans le monde, de mon nom; mais à présent je sais et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
je sens que s'il y a en moi quelque chose de bon et que si j'ai à
en rendre grâce à la Providence, c'est pour un c&oelig;ur bon,
sensible et capable d'amour, qu'il lui a plu de me donner et de
me conserver.</p>

<p>On 29th June he again notes in his Diary:</p>

<p class="i2">He whose aim is his own happiness, is bad; he whose aim is
the good opinion of others, is weak; he whose aim is the happiness
of others, is virtuous; he whose aim is God, is great.</p>


<h3>1852</h3>

<p>On 2nd July he completed <i>Childhood</i>, and a few days later
despatched the manuscript, signed only with the initials
L. N. T., to the best Petersburg monthly, <i>The
Contemporary</i>. On 28th August he received a reply
from the editor, the poet Nekrásof, saying he would
publish the story and that he thought its author had
talent. Another letter followed, dated 5th September 1852,
in which Nekrásof said that having re-read the story in
proof, he found it 'much better than I had realised at first.
I can say definitely that its author has talent.' He added
that it would appear in the next number of his magazine.</p>

<p>Tolstoy notes in his Diary: 'Received letter from Nekrásof;
praises, but no money.'</p>

<p>Nekrásof's next letter is dated 30th October, and explains
that it is not customary to pay authors for their first work,
but that he hopes Tolstoy will send him more stories, and
that in future he will pay him as much as to the very best
known writers, namely Rs. 50 (nearly £7 at that time) per
sheet of sixteen pages. He mentioned also that <i>Childhood</i>
had been very well received by the public.</p>

<p>Tolstoy kept his authorship a secret, revealing it to no
one except Nicholas and Aunt Tatiána. His sister Mary
was by this time back at her husband's estate, situated near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Tourgénef's village of Spássky. There Tourgénef came
one day to visit her, bringing with him the last number of
the <i>Contemporary</i>. Full of praise of a new story by an unknown
author, he began reading it aloud, and to her great
astonishment Mary recognised, one after another, various
incidents from her own childhood. Her first guess was that
Nicholas must have written it.</p>

<p>Among the writers who at once acclaimed Tolstoy's
genius was Panáef, co-editor of the <i>Contemporary</i>, who,
Tourgénef pretended, had to be carefully shunned by his
friends on the Névsky (the chief street in Petersburg) lest he
should insist on reading them extracts from the new story.
Before long the work reached Dostoyévsky in Siberia, and
he was so struck by it that he wrote to a friend asking him
to find out who the talented L. N. T. was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tolstoy continued his military career in the
Caucasus. On his return to Starogládovsk in August, he
had noted in his Diary: 'Simplicity&mdash;that is the quality
which above all others I desire to attain.'</p>

<p>He had to pass an unpleasant month in consequence of
the autumn man&oelig;uvres, about which he wrote: 'It was not
very pleasant to have to march about and fire off cannons;
especially as it disturbed the regularity of my life'; and
he rejoiced when it was over and he was again able to devote
himself to 'hunting, writing, reading, and conversation with
Nicholas.' He had become fond of shooting game, at which&mdash;as
at all physical exercises&mdash;he was expert; and he spent
two or three hours a day at it. He writes to his Aunt
Tatiána:</p>

<p class="i2">At 100 paces from my lodging I find wild fowl, and in
half an hour I kill 2, 3, or 4. Besides the pleasure, the
exercise is excellent for my health, which in spite of the
waters is not very good. I am not ill, but I often catch cold
and suffer from sore throat or from toothache or from rheumatism,
so that I have to keep to my room at least two days
in the week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
One of the forms of sport he enjoyed during his stay in
the Caucasus was strepet shooting: the strepet being a
steppe grouse. Before they migrate in mid-August, these
birds assemble in enormous flocks, and are extremely wild
and difficult of approach. It is hardly possible to get
within two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards of such
a flock. Tolstoy had a horse that was specially trained for
this particular sport. On it he used to ride at a foot-pace
two or three times round a flock, carefully narrowing the
circle till he got as near as possible without alarming the
birds. Then he would dash forward at full gallop with his
gun ready. The moment the birds rose he dropped his
reins on the horse's neck, and the well-trained animal would
instantly stop, allowing its master to take aim.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's military career was not giving him satisfaction.
Having left home without any definite plans, he had neglected
to bring any documents with him, and the result of this was
that instead of becoming an officer within eighteen months,
as he expected to do when he entered the army, he now, after
serving for ten months, received notice that he would have
to serve another three years before he could obtain his
commission.</p>

<p>In this difficulty he applied to his aunt P. I. Úshkof,
who by application to an influential friend eventually succeeded
in hastening his promotion. Meanwhile however
Tolstoy&mdash;who had made up his mind to retire from the
army as soon as he received his commission&mdash;almost lost
patience.</p>

<p>On 24th December he completed the sketch entitled
<i>The Raid: A Volunteer's Story</i>, and two days later posted
it to the <i>Contemporary</i>, in which magazine it appeared in
March 1853. The following passage occurs in this his
first story of war, and foreshadows the attitude he ultimately
made definitely his own. He is describing a march
through Caucasian scenery to a night attack on a Tartar
<i>Aoul</i>, and he says:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Nature, beautiful and strong, breathed conciliation.</p>

<p class="i2">Can it be that people have not room to live in this beautiful
world, under this measureless, starry heaven? Can feelings of
enmity, vengeance, or lust to destroy one's fellow beings, retain
their hold on man's soul amid this enchanting Nature? All
that is evil in man's heart should, one would think, vanish in
contact with Nature&mdash;this immediate expression of beauty and
goodness.</p>

<p>From the very start we find Tolstoy hampered in his work
by that incubus of all Russian writers, the Censor. In
a letter to his brother Sergius in May he writes: '<i>Childhood</i>
was spoilt, and <i>The Raid</i> simply ruined by the Censor.
All that was good in it has been struck out or mutilated.'
In comparing Tolstoy's literary achievement with that of
Western writers, one should make a large allowance for the
continual annoyance, delay, mutilation, and suppression
inflicted on him by that terrible satellite of despotism.</p>


<h3>1853</h3>

<p>In January, the battery in which Leo Tolstoy served
went on active service against Shámyl. The expedition
assembled at Fort Grózny, where scenes of
debauchery occurred.</p>

<p>On 18th February Tolstoy's life was in great danger.
A shell fired by the enemy smashed the carriage of a
cannon he was pointing. Strange to say he was not even
wounded. On 1st April he returned with his detachment to
Starogládovsk; and in May we find him writing to his
brother Sergius that he had applied for his discharge, and
hoped in six weeks' time to return home a free man. Difficult
as his admission to the army had been, he found,
however, that to retire was a yet harder matter, destined
to take not weeks but years.</p>

<p>On 13th June his life was again in danger owing to an
adventure which supplied him with the subject he utilised
later on in <i>A Prisoner in the Caucasus</i>.</p>

<p>It being dangerous to travel between the Russian forts
without an escort, non-combatants, as well as stores and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
baggage, were periodically convoyed from one post to
another. On these expeditions it was forbidden for any one
to detach himself from the main body; but the intolerable
slowness of the infantry march on a hot day, frequently
tempted those who were mounted, to ride on, and to run the
risk of being attacked by the 'Tartars' (who were generally
Circassians). On one such occasion five horsemen,
including Tolstoy and his friend Sádo, disobeyed the regulations
and rode ahead. The two friends ascended the
hillside to see whether any foes were visible, while their
three companions proceeded along the valley below. Hardly
had the two reached the crest of the ridge when they saw
thirty mounted Tartars galloping towards them. Calculating
that there was not time to rejoin their companions in the
valley, Tolstoy shouted them a warning, and raced off along
the ridge towards Fort Grózny, which was their destination.
The three did not, at first, take his warning seriously, but
wasting some precious moments before turning to rejoin the
column, were overtaken by the Tartars, and two of them
were very severely wounded before a rescue party from the
convoy put the enemy to flight. Meanwhile Tolstoy and
Sádo, pursued by seven horsemen along the hill ridge, had
to ride nearly three miles to reach the fort. It so happened
that Tolstoy was trying a young horse of Sádo's, while Sádo
was riding Tolstoy's ambler, which could not gallop. Though
Tolstoy could easily have escaped on Sádo's fiery horse, he
would not desert his comrade. Sádo had a gun, unluckily
not loaded, and so he could only make a pretence with it of
aiming at his pursuers. It seemed almost certain that both
fugitives would be killed; but apparently the Tartars decided
to capture them alive, perhaps wishing to revenge
themselves on Sádo for being a pro-Russian, and therefore
they did not shoot them down. At last a sentinel at Grózny
having espied their plight, gave the alarm and some
Cossacks galloped to their rescue. At sight of these, the
Tartars made off and the fugitives escaped uninjured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Tolstoy continued his habit of forming resolutions; and
about this time he wrote: 'Be straightforward, not rough,
but frank with all men; yet not childishly frank without any
need.... Refrain from wine and women ... the pleasure
is so small and uncertain, and the remorse so great....
Devote yourself completely to whatever you do. On experiencing
any strong sensation, wait; but having once
considered the matter, though wrongly, act decisively.'</p>

<p>From the middle of July to October, Tolstoy again
stayed at Pyatigórsk.</p>

<p>A companion he had brought with him to the Caucasus
was his black bulldog, Boúlka. He intended to leave it
at home, but after he had started, the dog had broken a
pane of glass and escaped from the room in which it was
confined, and when Tolstoy, after stopping at the first post-station,
was just resuming his journey, he saw something
black racing along the road after him. It was Boúlka, who
rushed to his master, licked his hand, and lay down panting
in the shade of a cart. The dog had galloped nearly
fourteen miles in the heat of the day, and was rewarded by
being taken to the Caucasus, where it was destined to meet
with many adventures.</p>

<p>On one occasion this dog boldly attacked a wild boar,
and had its stomach ripped open by the latter's tusk.
While its wound was being sewn up, the dog licked its
master's hand.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when Tolstoy was sitting at night
with a friend in the village street, intending to start for
Pyatigórsk at daybreak, they suddenly heard a sucking-pig
squeal, and guessed that a wolf was killing it. Tolstoy
ran into the house, seized a loaded gun, and returned in
time to see a wolf running straight towards him from the
other side of a wattle-fence. The wolf jumped on to the
top of the fence and descended close to Tolstoy who,
almost touching him with the muzzle of his gun, drew the
trigger. The gun missed fire, and the wolf raced off,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
chased by Boúlka and by Tolstoy's setter, Milton. The
wolf escaped, but not till it had snapped at Boúlka and
inflicted a slight wound on his head. Strange to say, the
wolf ventured to return a little later into the middle of the
street, and again escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>Not long after, in Pyatigórsk, shortly before Tolstoy
left the Caucasus, while drinking coffee in the garden of
his lodging, he heard a tremendous noise of men and dogs,
and, on inquiry, learnt that convicts had been let out of
gaol to kill the dogs, of whom there were too many in
the town, but that orders had been given to spare dogs
wearing collars. As ill-luck would have it, Tolstoy had
removed Boúlka's collar; and Boúlka, apparently recognising
the convicts as his natural enemies, rushed out into the
street and flew at one of them. A man had just freed
the long hook he carried, from the corpse of a dog he had
caught and held down while his companions beat it to
death with bludgeons. He now adroitly hooked Boúlka
and drew the unfortunate dog towards him, calling to
his mate to kill it, which the latter prepared to do.
Boúlka however bounded aside with such force that the
skin of his thigh burst where the hook held it, and with
tail between his legs and a red wound on his thigh, he
flew back into the house and hid under Tolstoy's bed.
His escape was not of much use. The wolf that had
snapped at him six weeks before must have been mad,
for Boúlka after showing premonitory symptoms of rabies,
disappeared, and was never heard of more.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's state of mind during the latter part of this
year is indicated by his letters. To his brother Sergius
he wrote on 20th July:</p>

<p class="i2">I think I already wrote you that I have sent in my resignation.
God knows, however, on account of the war with
Turkey, whether it will be accepted, or when. This disturbs
me very much, for I have now grown so accustomed to happy
thoughts of soon settling down in the country, that to return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to Starogládovsk and again wait unendingly&mdash;as I have to
wait for everything connected with my service&mdash;will be very
unpleasant.</p>

<p>Again, in December, he writes from Starogládovsk:</p>

<p class="i2">Please write about my papers quickly. This is necessary.
'<i>When shall I come home?</i>' God only knows. For nearly a
year I have been thinking only of how to sheath my sword,
but still cannot manage it. And as I must fight somewhere, I
think it will be pleasanter to do so in Turkey than here, and I
have therefore applied to Prince Serge Dmítrievitch [Gortchakóf]
about it, and he writes me that he has written to his
brother, but what the result will be, I do not know.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Tolstoy's paternal grandmother
was a Gortchakóf. Through her he was nearly
related to Prince S. D. Gortchakóf and to his brother,
Prince Michael Dmítrievitch Gortchakóf, who had been a
friend of his father's in the war of 1812, and was now in
command of the Russian army on the Danube.</p>

<p>The letter continues:</p>

<p class="i2">At any rate by New Year I expect to change my way of life,
which I confess wearies me intolerably. Stupid officers, stupid
conversations, and nothing else. If there were but a single
man to whom one could open one's soul! Tourgénef is right:
'What irony there is in solitude,'&mdash;one becomes palpably
stupid oneself. Although Nikólenka has gone off with the
hounds&mdash;Heaven knows why (Epíshka<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and I often call him
'a pig' for so doing)&mdash;I go out hunting alone for whole days
at a time from morning to evening, with a setter. That is my
only pleasure&mdash;and not a pleasure but a narcotic. One tires
oneself out, gets famished, sleeps like the dead, and a day has
passed. When you have an opportunity, or are yourself in
Moscow, buy me Dickens' <i>David Copperfield</i> in English, and
send me <i>Sadler's English Dictionary</i> which is among my books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Of the entries in his Diary at this time, we may note
the following:</p>

<p class="i2">All the prayers I have invented I replace by the one prayer,
'Our Father.' All the requests I can make to God are far more
loftily expressed and more worthily of Him, in the words 'Thy
Kingdom come, as in heaven so on earth.'</p>

<p>About this time he completed his <i>Memoirs of a Billiard
Marker</i>, and sent it to the <i>Contemporary</i> with a letter
expressing his own dissatisfaction with the hasty workmanship
of the story; it did not appear till more than a year
later. He was also now at work on <i>Boyhood</i>.</p>

<p>Seventeen years after Tolstoy had left the Caucasus, an
officer stationed at Starogládovsk found his memory still
fresh among the Cossacks, and saw Mariána (comparatively
aged by that time), as well as several elderly Cossack
hunters who had shot wild fowl and wild boars with
Tolstoy. In his regiment he left the reputation of being
an excellent narrator, who enthralled every one by his conversation.</p>


<h3>1854</h3>

<p>Not till January 1854 did the long-expected order
arrive allowing him to pass the examination (a pure
formality at that time) entitling him to become
an officer. On the 19th he left for home, and on
2nd February reached Yásnaya, where he enjoyed a three
weeks' stay with his Aunt Tatiána, his brother, and a friend.
On this journey he encountered a severe storm, to which
we owe <i>The Snow Storm</i>, published a couple of years later,
and probably also much of the storm description in <i>Master
and Man</i>, written in later life.</p>

<p>The Russo-Turkish war had now begun in earnest, and,
as a result of his application, he received orders to join the
army of the Danube, which he set out accordingly to do.</p>

<p>Of the Caucasian period of his life, as of his University
days, Tolstoy has at different times expressed himself
differently. To Birukóf, in 1905, he spoke of it as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the best times of his life, notwithstanding all his deflections
from his dimly recognised ideals. Yet two years
earlier, writing of the four periods of his life, he had
spoken of 'the terrible twenty years of coarse dissipation,
the service of ambition, vanity, and above all, of lust,'
which followed after the age of fourteen.</p>

<p>But what it comes to is, that Tolstoy is a man of moods,
and judges himself and others, sometimes by ordinary and
sometimes by extraordinary standards.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> twenty-five years of age it fell to Tolstoy's lot to take
part in a great European war and thereby to extend the
range of his experience in a way that considerably affected
his subsequent life and writings.</p>

<p>Tolstoy tells us that he got his first understanding of
war from Stendhal, the author of <i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i> and
<i>La Chartreuse de Parme</i>. In conversation with Paul
Boyer, Tolstoy once spoke of those novels as inimitable
works of art, adding, 'I am greatly indebted to Stendhal.
He taught me to understand war. Re-read the description
of the battle of Waterloo in <i>La Chartreuse de Parme</i>.
Who ever before so described war? Described it, that is,
as it is in reality? Do you remember Fabrice riding
over the field of battle and understanding "nothing"?'</p>

<p>Tolstoy's brother Nicholas, though fond of war, also
disbelieved in the popular romantic view of it, and used to
say: 'All <i>that</i> is embellishment, and in real war there is
no embellishment.'&mdash;'A little later, in the Crimea,' added
Tolstoy in his talk with Boyer, 'I had a grand chance to
see with my own eyes that this is so.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the causes that led to the war it need only be said
that the rule of the Turks over Christian populations had
long kept a dangerous sore open in Europe, and the consequent
diplomatic difficulties were complicated by the
indefiniteness of two lines in the Treaty of Kainardji,
which Catherine the Great had imposed upon Turkey in
1774. There was also friction between the Eastern and
Western Churches, with reference to the custody of the
Places in Palestine rendered holy by their traditional connection
with the Prince of Peace. Nicholas I, who had
wellnigh drilled all intelligence out of those near him in
his Government and in his army, was not accustomed to be
thwarted. Dimly conscious of the first faint symptoms of
that growth of Liberalism which a few years later, in the
early 'sixties, led to sweeping reforms in Russia, he felt
inclined to demonstrate the beneficence of his rule not by
allowing changes to be made at home, but by arbitrarily
inflicting reforms on Turkey. Failing to get his way by
diplomatic pressure, he rashly proceeded to occupy the
Danubian Principalities as a 'material guarantee' of
Turkey's compliance with his demands.</p>

<p>He was opposed by Austria and Prussia as strongly as
by England and France, and the pressure exerted by the
four powers sufficed to compel him to withdraw his army
from Turkish soil. Thereupon the war, which had as yet
been waged only between Russia and Turkey, might well
have ended, had not England and France undertaken a
quite needless invasion of the Crimea: an enterprise in
which Austria and Prussia refused to join. The end did
not justify the proceedings, for in spite of success in this
war, Napoleon the Third's dynasty crumbled to dust
within twenty years, while within a like period after
Palmerston's death Lord Salisbury frankly admitted that
we had 'put our money on the wrong horse.' As to
Nicholas I, his pride was destined to be bitterly mortified
by the results of an enterprise which not only failed of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
immediate object, but by its failure actually hastened the
coming of those reforms in Russia against which he had
set his face. Even Turkey did not really benefit by being
allowed to oppress her subject races for a couple of generations
longer.</p>

<p>It was the influence of Napoleon III, as Kinglake has
pointed out, that led England to take part in the war.
Having by treachery and murder made himself Emperor
of the French, that monarch found himself for a time
dangerously isolated from the support of people of good
repute. In consultation with Palmerston, he decided to
subordinate the traditional Eastern policy of his country
to that of England if thereby he could succeed in being
publicly paraded as the friend and ally of Queen Victoria.
As soon as he had secured an alliance with England, with
Palmerston's aid, and helped by the extraordinary war fever
which seized the English nation, he quickly forced the
peacefully disposed Lord Aberdeen along an inclined plane
which ultimately plunged both nations into a war for
which no sufficient motive justification or excuse existed.</p>


<h3>1854</h3>

<p>Hostilities between Russia and Turkey had begun in
October 1853, but France and England did not break off
negotiations with the former power till the end of
March 1854, the very month in which Tolstoy
reached Bucharest on his way through Wallachia to join
the army.</p>

<p>From there he wrote to his aunt, telling of his journey.
The roads after he had passed Khersón, and especially after
he had crossed the frontier, were abominable; his journey
lasted nine days; and he 'arrived almost ill with fatigue.'</p>

<p>A few days later, on 17th March, he wrote of his first
interview with Gortchakóf:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>Le prince Gortchakóf n'était pas ici. Hier il vient
d'arriver et je viens de chez lui. Il m'a reçu mieux que je ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
croyais&mdash;en vrai parent. Il m'a embrassé, il m'a engagé de
venir dîner tous les jours chez lui et il veut me garder auprès
de lui, mais ce n'est pas encore décidé.</p>

<p class="i2">Pardon, chère tante, que je vous écris peu&mdash;je n'ai pas encore
la tête à moi,&mdash;cette grande et belle ville, toutes ces présentations,
l'opéra italien, le théâtre français, les deux jeunes
Gortchakóf qui sont de très braves garçons ... de sorte que
je ne suis pas resté deux heures chez moi, et je n'ai pas pensé
à mes occupations.</p>

<p>On 22nd March he adds: 'I learnt yesterday that I am
not to remain with the Prince, but am to go to Oltenitza
to join my battery.'</p>

<p>In May he wrote:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>Tandis que vous me croyez exposé à tous les dangers de
la guerre je n'ai pas encore senti la poudre turque, et je suis
très tranquillement à Boukarest à me promener, à faire de la
musique et à manger des glaces. En effet tout ce temps,
excepté deux semaines que j'ai passées à Oltenitza où j'ai été
attaché à une batterie, et une semaine que j'ai passée en courses
par la Moldavie, Valachie et Bessarabie par ordre du gén.
Serjpoutóvsky auprès duquel je suis à présent <i>by special appointment</i>,
je suis resté à Boukarest et à vous avouer franchement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ce genre de vie un peu dissipé, tout à fait oisif et très coûteux
que je mène ici me déplaît infiniment. Auparavant c'était le
service qui m'y retenait, mais à présent j'y suis resté pendant
près de trois semaines à cause d'une fièvre que j'ai attrapée
pendant mon voyage, mais dont, Dieu merci, je suis pour le
moment assez rétabli pour rejoindre dans deux ou trois jours
mon général qui est au camp près de Silistrie. A propos de
mon général, il a l'air d'être un très brave homme et paraît,
quoique nous nous connaissons fort peu, être bien disposé à
mon égard. Ce qui est encore fort agréable est que son état-major
est composé pour la plupart de gens comme il faut.</p>

<p>We shall find Tolstoy modifying this opinion, a little
later on; but it is worth noting that at this time he was
fully alive to the superiority of '<i>gens comme il faut</i>,' and
that his depreciation of them in later years may have been
partly a reaction from a previous over-valuation.</p>

<p>By June 1854 the military and political situation was
as follows. The Russians had advanced through Moldavia
and Wallachia to the Danube, had crossed that river, and
were besieging Silistria. Austria, supporting the other
great powers, had massed a powerful army on the Turkish
frontier, and a glance at the map of Europe will show that
the Russian army, far removed from its base, was in
imminent danger of being cut off by the Austrians, who
peremptorily summoned Russia to evacuate the Principalities,
and on 14th June concluded a formal alliance with
the Porte. These circumstances explain the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
abandonment of the siege of Silistria mentioned in the
following letter, addressed by Leo Tolstoy to his Aunt
Tatiána and to his brother Nicholas conjointly; though
when he wrote it, the causes which produced the result he
described were a mystery to him.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>Je vais vous parler donc de mes souvenirs de Silistrie.
J'y ai vu tant de choses intéressantes, poétiques et touchantes
que le temps que j'y ai passé ne s'effacera jamais de ma mémoire.
Notre camp était disposé de l'autre côté du Danube c.à d. sur
la rive droite sur un terrain très élevé au milieu de superbes
jardins, appartenant à Mustafa Pasha&mdash;le gouverneur de Silistrie.
La vue de cet endroit est non seulement magnifique,
mais pour nous tous du plus grand intérêt. Sans parler du
Danube, de ces îles et de ces rivages, les uns occupés par nous,
les autres par les Turcs, on voyait la ville, la forteresse, les petits
forts de Silistrie comme sur la main. On entendait les coups
de canons, de fusils qui ne cessaient ni jour ni nuit, et avec
une lunette d'approche on pouvait distinguer les soldats turcs.
Il est vrai que c'est un drôle de plaisir que de voir de gens
s'entretuer et cependant tous les soirs et matins je me mettais
sur ma cart et je restais des heures entières à regarder et ce
n'était pas moi le seul qui le faisait. Le spectacle était vraiment
beau, surtout la nuit. Les nuits ordinairement mes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
soldats se mettent aux travaux des tranchées, et les Turcs se
jettent sur eux pour les en empêcher, alors il fallait voir et
entendre cette fusillade. La première nuit que j'ai passée au
camp ce bruit terrible m'a reveillé et effrayé, je croyais qu'on
est allé a l'assaut et j'ai bien vite fait seller mon cheval, mais
ceux qui avait déjà passé quelque temps au camp me dirent que
je n'avais qu'à me tenir tranquille, que cette canonnade et
fusillade était une chose ordinaire et qu'on appela en plaisantant,
'Allah'; alors je me suis recouché, mais ne pouvant m'endormir
je me suis amusé, une montre à la main, à compter les coups
de canon que j'entendais et j'ai compté 110 explosions dans
l'espace d'une minute. Et cependant tout ceci n'a eu de près
l'air aussi effrayant que cela le paraît. La nuit, quand on n'y
voyait rien, c'était à qui brûlerait le plus de poudre et avec ces
milliers de coups de canons on tuait tout au plus une trentaine
d'hommes de part et d'autre.</p>

<p class="i2">Ceci donc est un spectacle ordinaire que nous avions tous
les jours et dans lequel, quand on m'envoyait avec des ordres
dans les tranchées, je prenais aussi ma part; mais nous avions
aussi des spectacles extraordinaires, comme celui de la veille de
l'assaut quand on a fait sauter une mine de 240 pouds de poudre
sous un des bastions de l'ennemi. Le matin de cette journée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
le prince avait été aux tranchées avec tout son état-major
(comme le général auprès duquel j'étais en fait partie, j'y ai
aussi été) pour faire les dispositions définies&mdash;vu pour l'assaut
du lendemain. Le plan, trop long pour que je puisse l'expliquer
ici, était si bien fait, tout était si bien prévu que personne
ne doutait de la réussite. A propos de cela il faut que
je vous dise encore que je commence à avoir de l'admiration
pour le prince (au reste il faut en entendre parler parmi les
officiers et les soldats, non seulement je n'ai jamais entendu
dire du mal de lui, mais il est généralement adoré).</p>

<p class="i2">Je l'ai vu au feu pour la première fois pendant cette matinée.
Il faut voir cette figure un peu ridicule avec sa grande taille,
ses mains derrière le dos, sa casquette en arrière, ses lunettes
et sa manière de parler comme un dindon. On voit qu'il était
tellement occupé de la marche générale des affaires que les
balles et les boulets n'existaient pas pour lui; il s'expose au
danger avec tant de simplicité, qu'on dirait qu'il n'en a pas
l'idée et qu'involontairement qu'on n'a plus peur de lui que pour
soi-même; et puis donnant ses ordres avec tant de clarté et de
précision et avec cela toujours affable avec chacun. C'est un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
grand, c.à d. un homme qui s'est voué toute sa vie au service de
sa patrie et pas par l'ambition, mais par le devoir. Je vais vous
raconter un trait de lui qui se lie à l'histoire de cet assaut que
j'ai commencé à raconter. L'après-dîner du même jour on
a fait sauter la mine, et près de 600 pièces d'artillerie ont fait
feu sur le fort qu'on voulait prendre, et on continuait ce feu
pendant toute la nuit, c'était un de ces coups d'&oelig;il et une de
ces émotions qu'on n'oublie jamais. Le soir de nouveau le
prince, avec tout le tremblement, est allé coucher aux tranchées
pour diriger lui-même l'assaut qui devait commencer à 3 heures
de la nuit même.</p>

<p class="i2">Nous étions tous là et comme toujours à la veille d'une
bataille nous faisions tous semblant de ne pas plus penser de la
journée de demain qu'à une journée ordinaire et tous, j'en suis
sûr, au fond du c&oelig;ur ressentaient un petit serrement de c&oelig;ur
et pas même un petit mais un grand, à l'idée de l'assaut. Comme
tu sais que le temps qui précède une affaire est le temps le plus
désagréable&mdash;c'est le seul où on a le temps d'avoir peur, et la
peur est un sentiment des plus désagréables. Vers le matin,
plus le moment approchait, plus le sentiment diminuait et vers
3 heures quand nous attendions tous à voir partir le bouquet de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fusées qui était le signal de l'attaque&mdash;j'étais si bien disposé
que si l'on était venu me dire que l'assaut n'aurait pas lieu, cela
m'aurait fait beaucoup de peine. Et voilà que juste une heure
avant le moment de l'assaut arrive un aide de camp du maréchal
avec l'ordre d'ôter le siège de Silistrie. Je puis dire sans
craindre de me tromper que cette nouvelle a été reçue par tous&mdash;soldats,
officiers et généraux&mdash;comme un vrai malheur, d'autant
plus qu'on savait par les espions, qui nous venaient très
souvent de Silistrie, et avec lesquels j'avais très souvent l'occasion
de causer moi-même, on savait que ce fort pris,&mdash;chose
dont personne ne doutait&mdash;Silistrie ne pouvait tenir plus de
2 ou 3 jours. N'est-ce pas que si cette nouvelle devait faire de
la peine à quelqu'un ce devait être au prince, qui pendant toute
cette campagne ayant fait toute chose pour le mieux, au beau
milieu de l'action vit venir le maréchal sur son dos pour gâter
les affaires et puis ayant la seule chance de réparer nos revers
par cet assaut, il reçoit le contre ordre du maréchal au moment
de le commencer. Eh bien, le prince n'a pas eu un moment de
mauvaise humeur, lui, qui est si impressionable, au contraire il a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
été content de pouvoir éviter cette boucherie, dont il devait
porter la responsabilité et tout le temps de la retraite qu'il
a dirigé lui-même, ne voulant passer qu'avec le dernier des
soldats, qui s'est faite avec un ordre et une exactitude remarquables,
il a été plus gai qu'il n'a jamais été. Ce qui contribuait
beaucoup à sa bonne humeur, c'était l'émigration de près de
7000 familles bulgares, que nous prenons avec pour le souvenir
de la férocité des Turcs&mdash;férocité a laquelle malgré mon incredulité
j'ai été obligé de croire. Dès que nous avons quitté
des différents villages bulgares que nous occupions, les Turcs y
sont revenus et excepté les femmes assez jeunes pour un harem,
ils ont fait main basse sur tout ce qu'il y avait. Il y a un village
dans lequel je suis allé du camp pour y prendre du lait
et des fruits qui a été exterminé de la sorte. Alors dès que le
prince avait fait savoir aux Bulgares que ceux qui voulaient
pouvaient avec l'armée passer le Danube et devenir sujets
russes, tout le pays se soulève et tous avec leurs femmes, enfants,
chevaux, bétails arrivent au pont,&mdash;mais comme il était
impossible de les prendre tous, le prince a été obligé de refuser
à ceux qui sont venus les derniers et il fallait voir comme cela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
le chagrinait. Il recevait toutes les députations qui venaient
de ces pauvres gens, il causait avec chacun d'eux, tâchait de
leur expliquer l'impossibilité de la chose, leur proposait de passer
sans leurs chariots et leur bétail et en se chargeant de leurs
moyens de subsistence jusqu'à ce qu'ils arrivassent en Russie,
payant de sa propre bourse des vaisseaux particuliers pour les
transporter, en un mot faisant tout son possible pour faire
du bien à ces gens.</p>

<p class="i2">Oui, chère tante, je voudrais bien que votre prophétie se
réalise. La chose que j'ambitionne le plus, est d'être l'aide
de camp d'un homme comme lui que j'aime et que j'estime du
plus profond de mon c&oelig;ur. Adieu, chère et bonne tante;
je baise vos mains.</p>

<p>The army retired to Bucharest, and here, at an officers'
ball, Tolstoy seized an opportunity to beg Gortchakóf to
have him transferred to where service would be most
active.</p>

<p>The retreat from Silistria took place at the end of
June, and on 2nd August we find Tolstoy starting for
Russia. On the journey he fell ill and had to lie up in
hospital. On 13th November in Kishinéf he renewed
his application for an appointment in the Crimea, and was
ordered to Sevastopol, which he reached on the 20th of
that month.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3>1854</h3>

<p>The situation there, at this time, was the following.
The Allies had landed in the Crimea to the north of
Sevastopol on 14th September, and had defeated
the Russian army under Ménshikof on the 20th
at Alma. Instead of marching straight into the town,
which was almost undefended, they had then gone round
and encamped on the south side, where they remained
inactive till 17th October, by which time Todleben, an
engineer of rare genius, had thrown up earthworks and
mounted guns (many of them taken from the Russian ships
Ménshikof sank at the entrance to the Roadstead).
Ménshikof himself had practically abandoned the town,
withdrawing the bulk of his army northward; but the
situation was saved by the patriotism of just that section
of the Russian forces which had been least exposed to the
deadening influence of Nicholas the First's militarism,&mdash;namely
by the officers and men of the fleet. Inspired by
the example of the heroic Admiral Kornílof (who lost
his life during the siege) they rallied to the defence with
a courageous devotion seldom paralleled. Their example
awoke enthusiasm throughout Russia and compelled
Ménshikof to supply reinforcements, which enabled the
town to hold out for eleven months, in spite of the great
superiority of the Allies in rifles, artillery and the
modern equipments of war generally.</p>

<p>Tolstoy reached Sevastopol when the defence was
already fully organised, and when (in spite of the repulse
experienced by the Russians at Inkerman) the garrison
had gained confidence in their powers of resistance, and
had settled down to a dogged defence.</p>

<p>Of the hospitals, in which the wounded saw one
another's limbs amputated while waiting their own turn;
of the staff officers, who managed to amuse themselves
pretty well during the siege; of the commissariat officers,
flourishing amid the general havoc; as well as of the line
and non-commissioned officers and privates, upon whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the greatest hardships fell, Tolstoy gives vivid glimpses in
the Sketches he wrote during the siege.</p>

<p>A fortnight after his arrival he writes, from somewhere
outside the town, to his brother Sergius, apologising for
not having sent him a letter sooner, and adds:</p>

<p class="i2">So much have I learnt, experienced, and felt this year that I
positively do not know what to begin to describe, nor how to
describe it as I wish to.... Silistria is now ancient history, and
we have Sevastopol, of which I suppose you all read with beating
hearts, and where I was four days ago. Well, how can I tell
you all I saw there, and where I went and what I did, and
what the prisoners and wounded French and English say; and
<i>whether it hurts them and hurts very much</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and what heroes our
enemies are, especially the English? I will tell all that later
at Yásnaya or at Pirogóvo; and you will learn much of it from
me through the press. How this will happen, I will explain
later; but now let me give you an idea of the position of affairs
in Sevastopol. The town is besieged from one side, the south,
where we had no fortifications when the enemy approached it.
Now we have on that side more than 500 heavy guns, and
several lines of earthworks, positively impregnable. I spent
a week in the fortress, and to the last day used to lose my way
among that labyrinth of batteries, as in a wood. More than
three weeks ago the enemy advanced his trenches at one place
to within 200 yards, but gets no further. When he makes the
smallest advance he is overwhelmed with a hailstorm of shot
and shell.</p>

<p class="i2">The spirit of the army is beyond all description. In the
times of ancient Greece there was not such heroism. Kornílof,
making the round of the troops, instead of greeting them with,
'Good health to you, lads!' says: 'If you have to die, lads, will
you die?' and the troops shout, 'We'll die, Your Excellency!
Hurrah!' and they do not say it for effect. On every face one
saw that it was not jest but earnest; and 22,000 men have
already fulfilled the promise.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
A wounded soldier, almost dying, told me they captured
the 24th French Battery but were not reinforced; and he wept
aloud. A Company of Marines nearly mutinied because they
were to be withdrawn from batteries in which they had been
exposed to shell-fire for thirty days. The soldiers extract the
fuses from the shells. Women carry water to the bastions for
the soldiers. Many are killed and wounded. The priests
with their crosses go to the bastions and read prayers under
fire. In one brigade, the 24th, more than 160 wounded men
would not leave the front. It is a wonderful time! Now,
however, after the 24th, we have quieted down; it has become
splendid in Sevastopol. The enemy hardly fires, and all are
convinced that he will not take the town; and it is really impossible....
I have not yet succeeded in being in action even
once; but thank God that I have seen these people and live
in this glorious time. The bombardment of the 5th [17
October, n.s.] remains the most brilliant and glorious feat not
only in the history of Russia, but in the history of the world.
More than 1500 cannon were in action for two days against the
town, and not only did not cause it to capitulate, but did not
silence one two-hundredth part of our batteries. Though, I
suppose, this campaign is unfavourably regarded in Russia, our
descendants will place it above all others; do not forget that
we, with equal or even inferior forces, and armed only with
bayonets, and with the worst troops in the Russian army (such
as the 6th corps) are fighting a more numerous enemy aided by
a fleet, armed with 3000 cannon, excellently supplied with rifles
and with their best troops. I do not even mention the
superiority of their Generals.</p>

<p class="i2">Only our army could hold its ground and conquer (we shall
yet conquer, of that I am convinced) under such circumstances.
You should see the French and English prisoners (especially
the latter): they are each one better than the other&mdash;morally
and physically fine fellows. The Cossacks say it is even a pity
to cut them down, and alongside of them you should see
some Chasseurs or others of ours: small, lousy, and shrivelled
up.</p>

<p class="i2">Now I will tell you how you will get printed news from me of
the deeds of these lousy and shrivelled heroes. In our artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
staff, consisting, as I think I wrote you, of very good and
worthy men, a project has been started for publishing a military
newspaper, in order to maintain a good spirit in the army&mdash;a
cheap paper (at Rs. 3) and popularly written, so that the
soldiers may read it. We have drawn up a plan and submitted
it to the Prince. He likes the idea very much, and has
submitted the project and a specimen sheet which we also
wrote, for the Emperor's sanction. I and Stolýpin<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> are
advancing the money for the publication. I have been chosen
joint editor with a Mr. Konstantínof, who published <i>The
Caucasus</i>, a man experienced in such work. The paper will
publish descriptions of the battles (but not such dry and
mendacious ones as other papers) courageous deeds, biographies,
and obituaries of good men, especially the unknown; military
stories, soldiers' songs, and popular articles on engineering,
artillery, etc. This plan pleases me very much: in the first
place, I like the work; and secondly, I hope the paper will be
useful and not quite bad. It is as yet merely a project, until
we know the Emperor's reply, about which I confess I have
my fears. In the specimen sheet sent to Petersburg, we
rashly inserted two articles, one by me and one by Rostóvtsef,
not quite orthodox. For this business I want Rs. 1500, which
I have asked Valeryán to send me.</p>

<p class="i2">I, thank God, am well, and live happily and pleasantly since
I returned from Turkey. In general, my army service divides
up into two periods: beyond the frontier&mdash;horrid: I was ill,
poor, and lonely. This side of the frontier&mdash;I am well and
have good friends, though I am still poor: money simply runs
away.</p>

<p class="i2">As to writing, I do not write; but, as Aunty teases me by
saying, 'I test myself.' One thing disquiets me: this is the
fourth year I live without female society; and I may become
quite coarse and unsuited for family life, which I so enjoy.</p>

<p>A few days later his battery was moved to Simferópol,
a town lying to the north of Sevastopol, beyond the sphere
of actual fighting.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3>1855</h3>

<p>On 6th January (o.s.) he wrote to his Aunt:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>On ne se bat plus en rase campagne, à cause de l'hiver
qui est extraordinairement rigoureux, surtout à présent; mais le
siège dure toujours.... J'avais parlé je crois d'une occupation
que j'avais en vue et qui me souriait beaucoup; à présent que
la chose est décidée, je puis le dire. J'avais l'idée de fonder
un journal militaire. Ce projet auquel j'ai travaillé avec le
concours de beaucoup de gens très distingués fut approuvé par
le prince et envoyé à la décision de sa Majesté, mais l'empereur
a refusé.</p>

<p class="i2">Cette déconfiture, je vous l'avoue, m'a fait une peine infinie
et a beaucoup changé mes plans. Si Dieu veut que la campagne
de Crimée finisse bien et si je ne reçois pas une place
dont je sois content, et qu'il n'y ait pas de guerre en Russie,
je quitterai l'armée pour aller à Pétersbourg à l'académie
militaire. Ce plan m'est venu, 1° parce que je voudrais ne pas
abandonner la littérature dont il m'est impossible de m'occuper
dans cette vie de camp, et 2° parce qu'il me paraît que je
commence à devenir ambitieux, pas ambitieux, mais je voudrais
faire du bien et pour le faire il faut être plus qu'un Sub-Lieutenant;
3° parce que je vous verrai tous et tous mes amis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
In May he wrote again to his brother:</p>

<p class="i2">From Kishinéf on 1st November (o.s.), I petitioned to be
sent to the Crimea, partly in order to see this war, and partly
to break away from Serzhpoutóvsky's staff, which I did not like,
but most of all from patriotism, of which at that time, I confess,
I had a bad attack. I did not ask for any special appointment,
but left it to those in authority to dispose of my fate. In the
Crimea I was appointed to a battery in Sevastopol itself, where
I passed a month very pleasantly amid simple, good companions,
who are specially good in time of real war and danger. In
December our battery was removed to Simferópol, and there I
spent 6 weeks in a squire's comfortable house, riding into Simferópol
to dance and play the piano with young ladies, and in
hunting wild goats on the Tchatyrdag [the highest point of the
chain of mountains running across the southern part of the
Crimea] in company with officials. In January there was a
fresh shuffling of officers, and I was removed to a battery
encamped on the banks of the Belbék, 7 miles from Sevastopol.
There I got into hot water: the nastiest set of officers
in the battery; a Commander who, though good-hearted, was
violent and coarse; no comforts, and it was cold in the earth
huts. Not a single book, nor a single man with whom one
could talk; and there I received the Rs. 1500 [= about £180
at that time] for the newspaper, sanction for which had already
been refused; and there I lost Rs. 2500, and thereby proved to
all the world that I am still an empty fellow, and though the
previous circumstances may be taken into account in mitigation,
the case is still a very, very bad one. In March it became
warmer, and a good fellow, an excellent man, Brenévsky, joined
the battery. I began to recover myself; and on 1 April, at
the very time of the bombardment, the battery was moved to
Sevastopol, and I quite recovered myself. There, till 15 May
(o.s.) I was in serious danger, <i>i.e.</i> for four days at a time, at
intervals of eight days, I was in charge of a battery in the
4th Bastion; but it was spring and the weather was excellent,
there was abundance of impressions and of people, all the comforts
of life, and we formed a capital circle of well-bred fellows;
so that those six weeks will remain among my pleasantest re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>collections.
On 15 May Gortchakóf, or the Commander of the
Artillery, took it into his head to entrust me with the formation
and command of a mountain platoon at Belbék, 14 miles from
Sevastopol, with which arrangement I am up to the present
extremely well satisfied in many respects.</p>

<p>The transfer of Tolstoy from Sevastopol to Belbék was
not, as he supposed when he wrote this letter, a whim of
Gortchakóf's or of the Commander of the Artillery, but a
result of his having written the first of his three sketches
of the siege of Sevastopol, <i>Sevastopol in December</i>. The
article, though not published in the <i>Contemporary</i> till
June, had been read in proof by the Emperor Alexander II
[Nicholas had died 2nd March, n.s.], and had caused
him to give instructions to 'take care of the life of
that young man,' with the result that Tolstoy was
removed from Sevastopol. The Dowager Empress Alexándra
Fédorovna also read the story and, it is said, wept
over it.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, at this time (though I am not sure of
the date) that Tolstoy found himself obliged to consent to
the sale of the large wooden house in which he had been
born, for the wretched price of 5000 'assignation roubles'
(about £170). The house was taken to pieces, and
removed to the estate of the purchaser, where it still stands,
though not now in use.</p>

<p>Apropos of the above letter it should be mentioned that
the Fourth Bastion was the one English writers call 'the
Flagstaff Bastion.' It formed the southernmost point of
the fortifications, as a glance at the accompanying map will
show, and it was for a long time the point exposed to the
fiercest fire.</p>

<p>Throughout the siege Tolstoy was accompanied by
Alexis, one of the four serfs presented to the young
Tolstoys when they entered the University. This man
(who figures in more than one of Tolstoy's works under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the name of Alyósha) brought him his rations to the
bastion, a duty involving considerable danger. What the
bastions were like in the first months of the siege, we learn
from the following passages in the first part of <i>Sevastopol</i>:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="p113"><img src="images/p113.jpg" width="550"
height="419" alt="" title="" /></a></div>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
...You want to get quickly to the bastions, especially to
that Fourth Bastion about which you have been told so many
and such different tales. When any one says, 'I am going to the
Fourth Bastion,' a slight agitation or a too marked indifference is
always noticeable in him; if men are joking they say, 'You
should be sent to the Fourth Bastion.' When you meet some
one carried on a stretcher, and ask, 'Where from?' the answer
usually is, 'From the Fourth Bastion.'...</p>

<p class="i2">...Beyond this barricade the houses on both sides of the
street are unoccupied: there are no signboards, the doors are
boarded up, the windows smashed; here a corner of the walls
is knocked down, and there a roof is broken in. The buildings
look like old veterans who have borne much sorrow and privation;
they even seem to gaze proudly and somewhat contemptuously
at you. On the road you stumble over cannon-balls
that lie about, and into holes full of water, made in the stony
ground by bombs. You meet and overtake detachments of
soldiers, Cossacks, officers, and occasionally a woman or a child&mdash;only
it will not be a woman wearing a bonnet, but a sailor's
wife wearing an old cloak and soldier's boots. Farther along
the same street, after you have descended a little slope, you
will notice that there are now no houses, but only ruined walls
in strange heaps of bricks, boards, clay and beams, and before
you, up a steep hill, you see a black untidy space cut up by
ditches. This space you are approaching is the Fourth Bastion....
Here you will meet still fewer people and no women at
all, the soldiers walk briskly by, traces of blood may be seen
on the road, and you are sure to meet four soldiers carrying a
stretcher, and on the stretcher probably a pale, yellow face and
a blood-stained overcoat....</p>

<p class="i2">The whiz of cannon-ball or bomb near by, impresses you
unpleasantly as you ascend the hill, and you at once understand
the meaning of the sounds very differently from when
they reached you in the town.... You have hardly gone a
little way up, when bullets begin to whiz past you right and
left, and you will perhaps consider whether you had not better
walk inside the trench which runs parallel to the road; but the
trench is full of such yellow, liquid, stinking mud, more than
knee deep, that you are sure to choose the road, especially as
<i>everybody</i> keeps to the road. After walking a couple of hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
yards, you come to a muddy place much cut up, surrounded by
gabions, cellars, platforms, and dug-outs, and on which large
cast-iron cannon are mounted, and cannon-balls lie piled in
orderly heaps. All seems placed without any aim, connection,
or order. Here a group of sailors are sitting in the battery;
here, in the middle of the open space, half sunk in mud, lies a
shattered cannon; and there a foot-soldier is crossing the
battery, drawing his feet with difficulty out of the sticky mud.
Everywhere, on all sides and all about, you see bomb-fragments,
unexploded bombs, cannon-balls, and various traces of
an encampment, all sunk in the liquid, sticky mud. You think
you hear the thud of a cannon-ball not far off, and you seem to
hear the different sounds of bullets all around&mdash;some humming
like bees, some whistling, and some rapidly flying past with a
shrill screech like the string of some instrument. You hear the
awful boom of a shot which sends a shock all through you, and
seems most dreadful.</p>

<p class="i2">'So this is it, the Fourth Bastion! This is that terrible,
truly dreadful spot!' So you think, experiencing a slight feeling
of pride and a strong feeling of suppressed fear. But you
are mistaken; this is still not the Fourth Bastion. This is
only the Yazónovsky Redoubt&mdash;comparatively a very safe and
not at all dreadful place. To get to the Fourth Bastion you
must turn to the right, along that narrow trench, where a foot-soldier,
stooping down, has just passed. In this trench you
may again meet men with stretchers, and perhaps a sailor or a
soldier with spades. You will see the mouths of mines, dug-outs
into which only two men can crawl, and there you will see
the Cossacks of the Black Sea Battalions, changing their boots,
eating, smoking their pipes, and, in short, living. And you
will see again the same stinking mud, the traces of camp life,
and cast-iron refuse of every shape and form. When you have
gone some three hundred steps more, you come out at another
battery&mdash;a flat space with many holes, surrounded with gabions
filled with earth, and cannons on platforms, and the whole
walled in with earthworks. Here you will perhaps see four or
five soldiers playing cards under shelter of the breastworks;
and a naval officer, noticing that you are a stranger and inquisitive,
is pleased to show you his 'household' and everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that can interest you.... He will tell you (but only if you
ask) about the bombardment on the 5th of October; will tell
you how only one gun in his battery remained usable and only
eight gunners were left of the whole crew, and how, all the
same, next morning, the 6th, he fired all his guns. He will
tell you how a bomb dropped into one of the dug-outs and
knocked over eleven sailors; he will show you from an embrasure
the enemy's batteries and trenches, which are here not
more than seventy-five to eighty-five yards distant. I am afraid,
though, that when you lean out of the embrasure to have a
look at the enemy, you will, under the influence of the whizzing
bullets, not see anything; but if you do see anything, you will
be much surprised to find that this whitish stone wall which is
so near you, and from which puffs of white smoke keep bursting&mdash;that
this white wall is the enemy: is <i>him</i>, as the soldiers
and sailors say.</p>

<p class="i2">It is even very likely that the naval officer, from vanity, or
merely for a little recreation, will wish to show you some firing.
'Call the gunner and crew to the cannon'; and fourteen sailors&mdash;clattering
their hob-nailed boots on the platform, one putting
his pipe in his pocket, another still chewing a rusk&mdash;quickly
and cheerfully man the gun and begin loading.</p>

<p class="i2">Suddenly the most fearful roar strikes not only your ears
but your whole being, and makes you shudder all over. It is
followed by the whistle of the departing ball, and a thick cloud
of powder-smoke envelops you, the platform, and the moving
black figures of the sailors. You will hear various comments
by the sailors concerning this shot of ours, and you will notice
their animation, the evidences of a feeling which you had not
perhaps expected: the feeling of animosity and thirst for
vengeance which lies hidden in each man's soul. You will
hear joyful exclamations: 'It's gone right into the embrasure!
It's killed two, I think.... There, they're carrying them
off!' 'And now <i>he's</i> riled, and will send one this way,' some
one remarks; and really, soon after, you will see before you a
flash and some smoke; the sentinel standing on the breastwork
will call out 'Ca-n-non,' and then a ball will whiz past you and
squash into the earth, throwing out a circle of stones and mud.
The commander of the battery will be irritated by this shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and will give orders to fire another and another cannon, the
enemy will reply in like manner, and you will experience interesting
sensations and see interesting sights. The sentinel will
again call 'Cannon!' and you will have the same sound and
shock, and the mud will be splashed round as before. Or he
will call out 'Mortar!' and you will hear the regular and rather
pleasant whistle&mdash;which it is difficult to connect with the
thought of anything dreadful&mdash;of a bomb; you will hear this
whistle coming nearer and faster towards you, then you will
see a black ball, feel the shock as it strikes the ground, and
will hear the ringing explosion. The bomb will fly apart into
whizzing and shrieking fragments, stones will rattle into the
air, and you will be bespattered with mud.</p>

<p class="i2">At these sounds you will experience a strange feeling of
mingled pleasure and fear. At the moment you know the shot
is flying towards you, you are sure to imagine that this shot will
kill you, but a feeling of pride will support you and no one will
know of the knife that is cutting your heart. But when the
shot has flown past and has not hit you, you revive, and, though
only for a moment, a glad, inexpressibly joyous feeling seizes
you, so that you feel some peculiar delight in the danger&mdash;in
this game of life and death&mdash;and wish that bombs and balls
would fall nearer and nearer to you.</p>

<p class="i2">But again the sentinel, in his loud, thick voice, shouts
'Mortar!' again a whistle, a fall, an explosion; and mingled
with the last you are startled by the groans of a man. You
approach the wounded man just as the stretchers are brought.
Covered with blood and dirt he presents a strange, not human,
appearance. Part of the sailor's breast has been torn away....</p>

<p class="i2">'That's the way with seven or eight every day,' the naval
officer remarks to you, answering the look of horror on your
face, and he yawns as he rolls another yellow cigarette.</p>

<p>As the siege progressed, things became worse, and in
the last part of <i>Sevastopol</i> Tolstoy, after telling how one
of the characters felt satisfied with himself, continues:</p>

<p class="i2">This feeling, however, was quickly shaken by a sight he came
upon in the twilight while looking for the Commander of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bastion. Four sailors stood by the breastwork holding by its
arms and legs the bloody corpse of a man without boots or coat,
swinging it before heaving it over. (It was found impossible in
some parts to clear away the corpses from the bastions, and
they were, therefore, thrown out into the ditch, so as not to
be in the way at the batteries.) Volódya felt stunned for a
moment when he saw the body bump on the top of the breastwork
and then roll down into the ditch, but luckily for him
the Commander of the bastion met him just then and gave him
his orders, as well as a guide to show him the way to the
battery and to the bomb-proof assigned to his men. We will
not speak of all the dangers and disenchantments our hero
lived through that evening; how&mdash;instead of the firing he was
used to, amid conditions of perfect exactitude and order which
he had expected to meet with here also,&mdash;he found two injured
mortars, one with its mouth battered in by a ball, the other
standing on the splinters of its shattered platform; how he
could not get workmen to mend the platform till the morning;
how not a single charge was of the weight specified in the
Handbook; how two of the men under him were wounded,
and how he was twenty times within a hair's-breadth of death.
Fortunately a gigantic gunner, a seaman who had served with
the mortars since the commencement of the siege, had been
appointed to assist Volódya, and convinced him of the possibility
of using the mortars. By the light of a lantern, this
gunner showed him all over the battery as he might have
shown him over his own kitchen-garden, and undertook to have
everything right by the morning. The bomb-proof to which
his guide led him was an oblong hole dug in the rocky ground,
25 cubic yards in size and covered with oak beams nearly 2-1/2
feet thick. He and all his soldiers installed themselves in it.</p>

<p>It was during one of his sojourns in the Fourth Bastion,
that Tolstoy noted down in his Diary the following
prayer:</p>

<p class="i2">Lord, I thank Thee for Thy continual protection. How
surely Thou leadest me to what is good. What an insignificant
creature should I be, if Thou abandoned me! Leave me not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Lord; give me what is necessary, not for the satisfaction of my
poor aspirations, but that I may attain to the eternal, vast, unknown
aim of existence, which lies beyond my ken.</p>

<p>It was due to Tolstoy's own choice that he was exposed
to the rough life of the bastion, for Prince Gortchakóf, at
whose house he was a constant visitor, had offered him an
appointment on his staff. This offer, which at Silistria he
had so ardently desired, Tolstoy declined, having come to
the conclusion, subsequently expressed in his writings, that
the influence exercised by the staff on the conduct of a war
is always pernicious! This opinion not only influenced his
conduct, and expressed itself in his novels, but fitted into a
general view of life he ultimately arrived at, a view the
consequences of which must be dealt with in the sequel to
this work. For the moment, let it suffice to mention that
whereas he shows a keen appreciation of Admiral Kornílof's
achievement in rousing the spirit of the garrison, he nowhere
praises Todleben's achievement in organising the defence
of the town and improvising that 'labyrinth of batteries'
in which Tolstoy used constantly to lose his way. He
says, for instance:</p>

<p class="i2">Now you have seen the defenders of Sevastopol.... The
principal, joyous thought you have brought away is a conviction
of the strength of the Russian people; and this conviction you
gained, not by looking at all these traverses, breastworks,
cunningly interlaced trenches, mines and cannon, one on top
of another, of which you could make nothing; but from
the eyes, words and actions&mdash;in short, from seeing what is called
the 'spirit' of the defenders of Sevastopol.</p>

<p>To everything a man can do off his own bat and by his
own effort, Tolstoy is keenly alive and sympathetic; but
when it comes to a complex, co-ordinated plan, involving
the subordination of many parts to one whole, he is
suspicious or even hostile. Had he remained a subordinate
officer, or even a novelist, it would not have been specially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
necessary to draw attention to this peculiarity; but that
we may understand his later teachings, it is important to
note all the roots of feeling from which they grew, and
this one among the rest.</p>

<p>To get on however with our tale. One evening, while
Tolstoy was sitting with the adjutants of Count Osten-Sáken,
Commander of the Garrison, Prince S. S. Ouroúsof,
a brave officer and first-rate chess player (he took part in
the International Chess Tournament of 1862, in London)
and a friend of Tolstoy's, entered the room and wished to
speak to the General. An adjutant took him to Osten-Sáken's
room, and ten minutes later Ouroúsof passed out
again, looking very glum. After he had gone, the adjutant
explained that Ouroúsof had come to suggest that a challenge
should be sent to the English to play a game of
chess for the foremost trench in front of the Fifth Bastion:
a trench that had changed hands several times and had
already cost some hundreds of lives. Osten-Sáken had
naturally refused to issue the challenge.</p>

<p>On 16th August Tolstoy took part in the battle of the
Tchérnaya (Black River) in which the Sardinian contingent,
which had arrived in May to reinforce the Allies, much distinguished
itself. This last attempt to relieve Sevastopol
failed, as its forerunners had done. Three days later
Tolstoy wrote to his brother saying that he had not been
hurt, and that 'I did nothing, as my mountain artillery
was not called on to fire.'</p>

<p>The end of the siege was now approaching, and on 8th
September Tolstoy, having volunteered for service in Sevastopol,
reached the Star Fort on the North Side of the Roadstead
just in time to witness the capture of the Maláhof by
the French, as he has described in <i>Sevastopol in August</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="i2">On the North Side of the Roadstead, at the Star Fort, near
noon, two sailors stood on the 'telegraph' mound; one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
them, an officer, was looking at Sevastopol through the fixed
telescope. Another officer, accompanied by a Cossack, had
just ridden up to join him at the big Signal-post.... Along
the whole line of fortifications, but especially on the high
ground on the left side, appeared, several at a time, with
lightnings that at times flashed bright even in the noonday
sun, puffs of thick, dense, white smoke, that grew, taking
various shapes and appearing darker against the sky. These
clouds, showing now here now there, appeared on the hills,
on the enemy's batteries, in the town, and high up in the sky.
The reports of explosions never ceased, but rolled together and
rent the air.</p>

<p class="i2">Towards noon the puffs appeared more and more rarely, and
the air vibrated less with the booming.</p>

<p class="i2">'I say, the Second Bastion does not reply at all now!' said
the officer on horseback; 'it is quite knocked to pieces.
Terrible!'</p>

<p class="i2">'Yes, and the Maláhof, too, sends hardly one shot in reply to
three of theirs,' said he who was looking through the telescope.
'Their silence provokes me! They are shooting straight into
the Kornílof Battery, and it does not reply.'</p>

<p class="i2">'But look there! I told you that they always cease the
bombardment about noon. It's the same to-day. Come, let's
go to lunch; they'll be waiting for us already. What's the
good of looking?'</p>

<p class="i2">'Wait a bit!' answered the one who had possession of the
telescope, looking very eagerly towards Sevastopol.</p>

<p class="i2">'What is it? What?'</p>

<p class="i2">'A movement in the entrenchments, thick columns advancing.'</p>

<p class="i2">'Yes! They can be seen even without a glass, marching in
columns. The alarm must be given,' said the seaman.</p>

<p class="i2">'Look! look! They've left the trenches!'</p>

<p class="i2">And, really, with the naked eye one could see what looked
like dark spots moving down the hill from the French batteries
across the valley to the bastions. In front of these spots dark
stripes were already visibly approaching our line. On the
bastions white cloudlets burst in succession as if chasing one
another. The wind brought a sound of rapid small-arm firing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
like the beating of rain against a window. The dark stripes
were moving in the midst of the smoke and came nearer and
nearer. The sounds of firing, growing stronger and stronger,
mingled in a prolonged, rumbling peal. Puffs of smoke rose
more and more often, spread rapidly along the line, and at last
formed one lilac cloud (dotted here and there with little faint
lights and black spots) which kept curling and uncurling; and
all the sounds blent into one tremendous clatter.</p>

<p class="i2">'An assault!' said the naval officer, turning pale and letting
the seaman look through the telescope.</p>

<p class="i2">Cossacks galloped along the road, some officers rode by, the
Commander-in-Chief passed in a carriage with his suite. Every
face showed painful excitement and expectation.</p>

<p class="i2">'It's impossible they can have taken it,' said the mounted
officer.</p>

<p class="i2">'By God, a standard!... Look! look!' said the other,
panting, and he walked away from the telescope: 'A French
standard on the Maláhof!'</p>

<p>The point from which the officer in the story, and
Tolstoy himself in reality, watched the assault through a
telescope is the spot marked 'a' on the map on <a href="#Page_112">page 112</a>.</p>

<p>The loss of the Maláhof rendered the further defence of
the town impossible, and the following night the Russians
blew up and destroyed such munitions of war as they could
not remove from the bastions. Tolstoy was deputed to
clear the Fifth and Sixth Bastions before they were abandoned
to the Allies. When telling me this he added,
'The non-commissioned officers could have done the work
just as well without me.' While the destruction was
proceeding, the Russian forces crossed the Roadstead by
a pontoon bridge which had been constructed during the
siege. The town south of the Roadstead was abandoned,
and the defenders established themselves on the North Side,
where they remained till peace was concluded in February
1856.</p>

<p>After the retreat, Tolstoy was given the task of collating
the twenty or more reports of the action from the Artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Commanders. This experience of how war is recorded
produced in him that supreme contempt for detailed
military histories which he so often expressed in later years.
He says:</p>

<p class="i2">I regret that I did not keep a copy of those reports. They
were an excellent example of that naïve, inevitable kind of
military falsehood, out of which descriptions are compiled. I
think many of those comrades of mine who drew up those
reports, will laugh on reading these lines, remembering how,
by order of their Commander, they wrote what they could
not know.</p>

<p>Carrying among other despatches the report he had
himself compiled, Tolstoy was sent as Courier to Petersburg;
and this terminated his personal experience of war.
He was still only Sub-Lieutenant, his hopes of promotion
had come to nothing in consequence of a suspicion that he
was the author of some soldiers' songs which were sung
throughout the army at this time. No translation can do
justice to these slangy, topical satires; but that the reader
may have some idea of them, my wife has put into English
the following stanzas:</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the responsibility for these songs,
which gave satirical expression to the discontent then very
generally felt, was not entirely Tolstoy's. They originated
with a group of officers on the staff of Kryzhanóvsky, Commander
of the Artillery, and some others (including Tolstoy)
who used to meet at Kryzhanóvsky's rooms almost daily.
One of this company used to preside at the piano, while
the others stood round and improvised couplets. In such
cases some one has usually to pay the piper, and that this
one should have been Tolstoy, was a natural result both
of the fact that he seems to have been the chief culprit,
and of the attention his literary work was attracting at
this time.</p>

<p>Another matter which appears to have done Tolstoy no
good in the eyes of his superiors, was his refusal to fall in
with a reprehensible practice which by long usage had
become as well established as, for instance, among ourselves,
is the purchase of peerages by contributions to
Party funds.</p>

<p>Those in command of various divisions of the army,
including the Commanders of Batteries, used to pay for
various things, such as shoes for the horses, medicine, office
expenses, and certain extras for the soldiers, for which no
official allowance was made; and the way the money for
this was obtained was by overestimating the cost and
quantity of stores, and of the fodder required for the
horses. The difference between the actual and estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cost supplied a revenue which different Commanders used
in different ways. Some spent it all for the good of the
service, though in a manner not shown in the accounts;
others did not scruple to make private profit of it.
Tolstoy, during his command of a battery, refused to
take a balance of cash which had accumulated, and insisted
on showing it in the accounts. He thereby evoked the
displeasure of less scrupulous Commanders and called down
upon himself a rebuke from General Kryzhanóvsky, who did
not consider that it lay with a Sub-Lieutenant in temporary
command, to attempt to upset so well-established a custom.
From his letters and memoirs we get clear indications of
Tolstoy's feelings towards his brother officers; his distaste
for the common run of them, and his preference for those
who were gentlemanly. Here and there, in memoirs and
magazine articles, one finds records of the impression he
in his turn produced on his companions. One of them
relates:</p>

<p class="i2">How Tolstoy woke us all up in those hard times of war, with
his stories and his hastily composed couplets! He was really
the soul of our battery. When he was with us we did not
notice how time flew, and there was no end to the general
gaiety.... When the Count was away, when he trotted off to
Simferópol, we all hung our heads. He would vanish for one,
two or three days.... At last he would return&mdash;the very
picture of a prodigal son! sombre, worn out, and dissatisfied
with himself.... Then he would take me aside, quite apart,
and would begin his confessions. He would tell me all: how
he had caroused, gambled, and where he had spent his days and
nights; and all the time, if you will believe me, he would condemn
himself and suffer as though he were a real criminal.
He was so distressed that it was pitiful to see him. That's the
sort of man he was. In a word, a queer fellow, and, to tell the
truth, one I could not quite understand. He was however a
rare comrade, a most honourable fellow, and a man one can
never forget!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
One who entered the battery just after Tolstoy left it,
says he was remembered there as an excellent rider, first-rate
company, and an athlete who, lying on the floor, could
let a man weighing thirteen stone be placed on his hands,
and could lift him up by straightening his arms. At a
tug-of-war (played not with a rope, but with a stick) no
one could beat him; and he left behind him the recollection
of many witty anecdotes told in that masterly style of
which he never lost the knack.</p>

<p>His private Diary bears witness to the constantly renewed
struggle that went on within him, as well as to his profound
dissatisfaction with himself. Here, for instance, is an estimate
entered in his Diary at the commencement of the war,
while he was still at Silistria:</p>

<p class="i2">I have no modesty. That is my great defect. What am I?
One of four sons of a retired lieutenant-colonel, left at seven
years of age an orphan under the guardianship of women and
strangers; having neither a social nor a scholarly education,
and becoming my own master at seventeen; with no large
means, no social position, and, above all, without principle;
a man who has disorganised his own affairs to the last extremity,
and has passed the best years of his life without aim
or pleasure; and finally who having banished himself to the
Caucasus to escape his debts and more especially his bad habits&mdash;and
having there availed himself of some connection that had
existed between his father and the general in command&mdash;passed
to the army of the Danube at twenty-six, as a Sub-Lieutenant
almost without means except his pay (for what means he has he
ought to employ to pay what he still owes) without influential
friends, ignorant of how to live in society, ignorant of the
service, lacking practical capacity, but with immense self-esteem&mdash;such
is my social position. Let us see what I myself
am like.</p>

<p class="i2">I am ugly, awkward, uncleanly, and lack society education.
I am irritable, a bore to others, not modest, intolerant, and as
shame-faced as a child. I am almost an ignoramus. What I do
know, I have learned anyhow, by myself, in snatches, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sequence, without a plan, and it amounts to very little. I am
incontinent, undecided, inconstant and stupidly vain and vehement,
like all characterless people. I am not brave. I am not
methodical in life, and am so lazy that idleness has become an
almost unconquerable habit of mine.</p>

<p class="i2">I am clever, but my cleverness has as yet not been thoroughly
tested on anything; I have neither practical nor social nor
business ability.</p>

<p class="i2">I am honest, that is to say, I love goodness, and have formed
a habit of loving it, and when I swerve from it I am dissatisfied
with myself and return to it gladly; but there is a thing I love
more than goodness, and that is fame. I am so ambitious, and
so little has this feeling been gratified, that should I have to
choose between fame and goodness, I fear I may often choose
the former.</p>

<p class="i2">Yes, I am not modest, and therefore I am proud at heart,
though shame-faced and shy in society.</p>

<p>That is a grossly unfair estimate of himself, but shows
just that sort of eager injustice to any one who fails to
reach the high standard he sets up, that has always
characterised him. His account is inaccurate in details.
For instance, he was not seven, but nearly nine when his
father died. He had not wrecked his affairs to the extent
he suggests. Though his studies had been desultory, he
had read widely, with a quick understanding and a retentive
memory. He was master of the Russian, French
and German languages, besides having some knowledge of
English, Latin, Arabic, and Turco-Tartar. (Later in life
he added a knowledge of Italian, Greek and Hebrew.) As
for not yet having tested his cleverness: he had published
stories for which the editor of the best Russian magazine
paid him the rate accorded to the best-known writers;
while his awkwardness in society did not depend on ignorance;
on the contrary, he had grown up among people who
paid much attention to manners, and he was himself gifted
with social tact, which became plainly apparent as soon as
he attained self-confidence. Any defect in his manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
must have been merely a result of that nervous shyness
natural to highly-strung, sensitive natures, conscious of
powers of a kind society recognises but scantily. Yet, when
all is said, his description gets home: over-emphatic and
unfair, like much of his other writing, it still leaves you in
no doubt as to what he meant, and hits the real points of
weakness in the victim he is flaying.</p>

<p>On 5th March 1855 (old style) when he was just
recovering from that fit of depression at Belbék which, as
already mentioned, drove him to gamble, he writes in his
Diary:</p>

<p class="i2">A conversation about Divinity and Faith has suggested to me
a great, a stupendous idea, to the realisation of which I feel
myself capable of devoting my life. This idea is the founding
of a new religion corresponding to the present state of mankind:
the religion of Christianity, but purged of dogmas and
mysticism: a practical religion, not promising future bliss, but
giving bliss on earth. I understand that to accomplish this
the conscious labour of generations will be needed. One
generation will bequeath the idea to the next, and some day
fanaticism or reason will accomplish it. <i>Deliberately</i> to promote
the union of mankind by religion&mdash;that is the basic thought
which, I hope, will dominate me.</p>

<p>In that passage one has, quite clearly stated before he
was twenty-seven, the main idea which actuated Tolstoy
from the age of fifty onwards. Already by the literary
work he accomplished amid the bustle and excitement of
the siege, he was half consciously moving in the direction
that allured him. During the three months that elapsed
between leaving Bucharest and reaching Sevastopol, he
wrote part of <i>The Wood-Felling</i>; a sketch of an expedition
such as he had taken part in the Caucasus; and during
the siege of Sevastopol he wrote the first two parts of
<i>Sevastopol</i> and began <i>Youth</i>, a sequel to <i>Childhood</i> and
<i>Boyhood</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>


<h3>1855</h3>

<p>It was <i>Sevastopol</i> that first brought European fame
to Tolstoy. When, as already mentioned, <i>Sevastopol in
December</i> appeared in the June <i>Contemporary</i>,
the Emperor ordered it to be translated into
French. That same month Tolstoy completed and despatched
<i>The Wood-Felling</i>; in July he sent off <i>Sevastopol in
May</i>. Here once again the Censor exercised his malignant
power, and Panáef wrote to Tolstoy from Petersburg:</p>

<p class="i2">In my letter delivered to you by Stolýpin, I wrote that your
article has been passed by the Censor with unimportant alterations,
and begged you not to be angry with me that I was
obliged to add a few words at the end to soften.... 3000
copies of the article had already been printed off, when the
Censor suddenly demanded it back, stopped the appearance of
the number (so that our August number only appeared in
Petersburg on 18 August) and submitted it to Poúshkin, President
of the Committee of Censors. If you know Poúshkin, you
will be able partly to guess what followed. He flew into a rage,
was very angry with the Censor, and with me for submitting
such an article to the Censor, and altered it with his own hand....
On seeing these alterations I was horror-struck, and wished
not to print the article at all, but Poúshkin explained to me
that I must print it in its present shape. There was no help
for it, and your mutilated article will appear in the September
number, but without your initials&mdash;which I could not bear to
see attached to it after that....</p>

<p class="i2">Now a word as to the impression your story produces on all
to whom I have read it in its original form. Every one thinks
it stronger than the first part, in its deep and delicate analysis
of the emotions and feelings of people constantly face to face
with death, and in the fidelity with which the types of the line-officers
are caught, their encounters with the aristocrats, and
the mutual relations of the two sets. In short, all is excellent,
all is drawn in masterly fashion; but it is all so overspread with
bitterness, is so keen, so venomous, so unsparing and so cheerless,
that at the present moment when the scene of the story
is almost sacred ground, it pains those who are at a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from it; and the story may even produce a very unpleasant
impression.</p>

<p class="i2"><i>The Wood-Felling</i>, with its dedication to Tourgénef, will also
appear in September (Tourgénef begs me to thank you very, very
much for thinking of him and paying him this attention)....
In this story also (which passed three Censors: the Caucasian,
the Military, and our Civil Censor) the types of officers have
been tampered with, and unfortunately a little has been
struck out.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's dedication of <i>The Wood-Felling</i> to Tourgénef
proceeded from his admiration for that writer's <i>A Sportsman's
Sketches</i>, which to the present time he continues to
value very highly, considering Tourgénef's descriptions of
Nature in that book not merely excellent, but inimitable by
any one else.</p>

<p>Nekrásof wrote to Tolstoy in September, about <i>Sevastopol
in August</i>, saying:</p>

<p class="i2">The revolting mutilation of your article quite upset me.
Even now I cannot think of it without regret and rage. Your
work will, of course, not be lost ... it will always remain as
proof of a strength able to utter such profound and sober truth
under circumstances amid which few men would have retained
it. It is just what Russian society now needs: the truth&mdash;the
truth, of which, since Gógol's death, so little has remained in
Russian literature. You are right to value that side of your
gifts most of all. Truth&mdash;in such form as you have introduced
it into our literature&mdash;is something completely new among us.
I do not know another writer of to-day who so compels the
reader to love him and sympathise heartily with him, as he to
whom I now write; and I only fear lest time, the nastiness of
life, and the deafness and dumbness that surround us, should
do to you what it has done to most of us, and kill the energy
without which there can be no writer&mdash;none, at least, such as
Russia needs. You are young: changes are taking place
which, let us hope, may end well, and perhaps a wide
field lies before you. You are beginning in a way that
compels the most cautious to let their expectations travel
far....</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<i>The Wood-Felling</i> has passed the Censor pretty fairly,
though from it also some valuable touches have disappeared.
...In that sketch there are many astonishingly acute
remarks, and it is all <i>new</i>, interesting, and to the point.
Do not neglect such sketches. Of the common soldier our
literature has as yet not spoken, except frivolously.</p>

<p>Tourgénef, writing from his estate at Spássky to
Panáef, said:</p>

<p class="i2">Tolstoy's article about Sevastopol is wonderful! Tears came
into my eyes as I read it, and I shouted, Hurrah! I am greatly
flattered by his wish to dedicate his new tale to me.... Here
his article has produced a general furore.</p>

<p>By the side of these contemporary estimates one may
set Kropótkin's appreciation written fifty years later:</p>

<p class="i2">All his powers of observation and war-psychology, all his deep
comprehension of the Russian soldier, and especially of the
plain un-theatrical hero who really wins the battles, and a profound
understanding of that inner spirit of an army upon which
depend success and failure: everything, in short, which developed
into the beauty and the truthfulness of <i>War and Peace</i>,
was already manifested in these sketches, which undoubtedly
represented a new departure in war-literature the world over.</p>

<p>It is worth while to note the very different conclusions
to which Kinglake, the historian of this war, and Tolstoy,
its novelist, arrived. Kinglake holds the war to have been
unnecessary, and attributes it chiefly to the unscrupulous
ambition of Napoleon III; yet he blames the Peace Party
very severely for protesting against it, for had they not
done so Nicholas, he thinks, would not have dared to act
aggressively. Kinglake feels that negotiations between
rulers and diplomatists are important, and that anything
that prevents a Government from speaking with authority,
makes for confusion and disaster.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, on the other hand (if I may anticipate and
speak of conclusions not definitely expressed by him till
much later), regards all war and preparation for war as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
immoral, and wishes this conviction to become so strong
and so general that it will be impossible for any future
Napoleon to plunge five nations into war to gratify his
own ambition.</p>

<p>Kinglake understands things as they are, and knows
how easy it is to do harm with good intentions, but is
somewhat blind to the trend of human progress, and as
to what the aim before us should be. Tolstoy, on the
contrary, is chiefly concerned about the ultimate aim, and
about the state of mind of the individual. The actual
working of our political system and international relations
are things he ignores. The English writer sees clearly
what is, and cares little about what should be; the
Russian writer cares immensely about what should be, and
rather forgets that it can only be approached by slow and
difficult steps, to take which surefootedly, needs an
appreciation of things as they are.</p>

<p>Neither of them manages to say the word which would
synthesize their divergent views: namely, that no self-respecting
people should support or tolerate as rulers,
men who seek to gain national advantages by means not
strictly fair, honest and even generous. That is the real
key to the world's future peace. Kinglake's appeal to us
not to hamper the government that represents us, and
Tolstoy's appeal to us not to spend our lives in preparing
to slay our fellow men, can both be met in that way, and,
I think, in that way alone.</p>

<p>For an ambitious young officer actually engaged in a
war, related to the Commander-in-Chief, and favourably
noticed by the Emperor, even <i>partially</i> to express disapproval
of war, was difficult; and Tolstoy has told me
that, contending with his desire to tell the truth about things
as he saw it, he was at the same time aware of another
feeling prompting him to say what was expected of him.</p>

<p>He, however, like the child in Andersen's story who sees
that the king has nothing on, when every one else is in
ecstasies over the magnificence of the monarch's robes, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the gift of seeing things with his own eyes, as well as a
great gift of truthfulness. These were the qualities which
ultimately made him the greatest literary power of his
century; and in spite of his own hesitation and the
Censor's mutilations, we may still read the description he
then wrote of the truce in which the French and Russian
soldiers hobnobbed together in friendship, a description
closing with these words:</p>

<p class="i2">White flags are on the bastions and parallels; the flowery
valley is covered with corpses; the beautiful sun is sinking
towards the blue sea; and the undulating blue sea glitters in
the golden rays of the sun. Thousands of people crowd together,
look at, speak to, and smile at one another. And these
people&mdash;Christians confessing the one great law of love and
self-sacrifice&mdash;seeing what they have done, do not at once fall
repentant on their knees before Him who has given them life
and laid in the soul of each a fear of death and a love of goodness
and of beauty, and do not embrace like brothers with tears
of joy and happiness.</p>

<p class="i2">The white flags are lowered, again the engines of death and
suffering are sounding, again innocent blood flows, and the air
is filled with moans and curses.</p>

<p>In <i>Sevastopol</i>, and in Tennyson's <i>Charge of the Light
Brigade</i> (with its rhymes about 'hundred' and 'thundered,'
and its panegyric of those who knew it was not
their business to think, and at whom 'all the world
wondered'), we have two typical expressions of conflicting
views on war: the view of a man who knew it from the
classics and was Poet Laureate, and the view of a man who
was in the thick of it, and whose eyes were connected with
his brain.</p>

<p>Thirty-four years later Tolstoy wrote a Preface to a
fellow-officer's <i>Recollections of Sevastopol</i>. It could not
pass the Censor, but has been used as a Preface to his
own sketches of war in the English version of <i>Sevastopol</i>,
translated by my wife and myself, and I cannot conclude
this chapter better than by quoting a few sentences from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Speaking of the position of a young officer engaged in
the Crimean war, he says:</p>

<p class="i2">To the first question that suggests itself to every one, Why did
he do it? Why did he not cease, and go away?&mdash;the author
does not reply. He does not say, as men said in olden times
when they hated their enemies as the Jews hated the Philistines,
that he hated the Allies; on the contrary, he here and
there shows his sympathy for them as for brother men.</p>

<p class="i2">Nor does he speak of any passionate desire that the keys of
the Church at Jerusalem should be in our hands, or even that
our fleet should, or should not, exist. You feel as you read, that
to him the life and death of men are not commensurable with
questions of politics. And the reader feels that to the question:
Why did the author act as he did?&mdash;there is only one answer;
It was because I enlisted while still young, or before the war
began, or because owing to inexperience I chanced to slip into
a position from which I could not extricate myself without
great effort. I was entrapped into that position, and when
they obliged me to do the most unnatural actions in the world,
to kill my brother men who had done me no harm, I preferred
to do this rather than to suffer punishment and disgrace....
One feels that the author knows there is a law of God: love
thy neighbour, and therefore do not kill him,&mdash;a law which
cannot be repealed by any human artifice.</p>

<p class="i2">The merit of the book consists in that. It is a pity it is only
felt, and not plainly and clearly expressed. Sufferings and
deaths are described; but we are not told what caused them.
Thirty-five years ago&mdash;even that was well, but now something
more is needed. We should be told what it is that causes
soldiers to suffer and to die,&mdash;that we may know, and understand,
and destroy these causes.</p>

<p class="i2">'War! How terrible,' people say, 'is war, with its wounds,
bloodshed, and deaths! We must organise a Red Cross Society
to alleviate the wounds, sufferings and pains of death.' But,
truly, what is dreadful in war is not the wounds, sufferings and
deaths. The human race that has always suffered and died,
should by this time be accustomed to suffering and death, and
should not be aghast at them. Without war people die by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
famine, by inundations, and by epidemics. It is not suffering
and death that are terrible, but it is that which allows people to
inflict suffering and death....</p>

<p class="i2">It is not the suffering and mutilation and death of man's
body that most needs to be diminished,&mdash;but it is the mutilation
and death of his soul. Not the <i>Red</i> Cross is needed,
but the simple cross of Christ to destroy falsehood and
deception....</p>

<p class="i2">I was finishing this Preface when a cadet from the Military
College came to see me. He told me that he was troubled by
religious doubts.... He had read nothing of mine. I spoke
cautiously to him of how to read the Gospels so as to find in
them the answers to life's problems. He listened and agreed.
Towards the end of our conversation I mention wine, and
advised him not to drink. He replied: 'but in military service
it is sometimes necessary.' I thought he meant necessary for
health and strength, and I intended triumphantly to overthrow
him by proofs from experience and science, but he continued:
'Why, at Geok-Tepe, for instance, when Skóbelef had to
massacre the inhabitants, the soldiers did not wish to do it, but
he had drink served out and then....' Here are all the
horrors of war&mdash;they are in this lad with his fresh young face,
his little shoulder-straps (under which the ends of his hood are
so neatly tucked), his well-cleaned boots, his naïve eyes, and
with so perverted a conception of life.</p>

<p class="i2">This is the real horror of war!</p>

<p class="i2">What millions of Red Cross workers could heal the wounds
that swarm in that remark&mdash;the result of a whole system of
education!</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A number</span> of distinguished writers have recorded their
opinions of the talented young officer who appeared in
Petersburg before the war was quite over, and immediately
entered the fraternity then supporting the
<i>Contemporary</i>. From their memoirs one sees what
Tolstoy was like at this, perhaps the stormiest and least
satisfactory period of his life.</p>

<p>The <i>Contemporary</i> was a monthly review founded by
Poúshkin and Pletnéf in 1836. It passed in 1847 to
Panáef and the poet Nekrásof, and when Tolstoy began to
write, was recognised as the leading and most progressive
Russian literary periodical. Its chief contributors formed
an intimate group, united by close personal acquaintance,
by sympathy with the Emancipation movement then
making itself felt, and also by a common agreement (not
it is true very strictly or very permanently observed) to
write exclusively for the <i>Contemporary</i>. The point to be
noticed is that the circle Tolstoy entered consisted of a
friendly, sociable group of people who considered themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
ardent reformers; and that though Tolstoy's talent and
his wish to have his works published, threw him and them
together, he never appears to have had the least inclination
to co-operate on that footing of mutual give-and-take
toleration which is so essential in public life. Certainly
he never became friendly with the more advanced men,
Tchernyshévsky, Miháylof, and the ultra-democratic Dobrolúbof,
who were intent on spreading democratic and
socialistic ideas in Russia.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that this was due to the fact
that he was an aristocrat and that they were democrats;
but one has to go deeper than that for the explanation,
which lies, to a considerable extent, in the fact that the
advanced Russian Radicals were, for the most part,
admirers of Governmental Jacobinism, whereas Tolstoy
has from the very start tended to be a No-Government
man, an Anarchist, and has objected to linking himself
closely with any group, since such alliance always implies
some amount of compromise, and some subordination of
one's own opinions.</p>

<p>The poet Fet, himself a young officer, made Tolstoy's
acquaintance at this time. A couple of years later he
purchased an estate at no very great distance from Yásnaya
Polyána, and became a friend of Tolstoy's&mdash;one in fact
of the very few people, not of his own family, with whom
the latter ever formed a close personal friendship.</p>


<h3>1855</h3>

<p>His first acquaintance with Tolstoy was however hardly
auspicious. Calling on Tourgénef in St. Petersburg
at ten o'clock one morning, he saw an officer's
sword hanging in the hall, and asked the man-servant
whose it was. 'It's Count Tolstoy's sword,' replied the
man. 'He is sleeping in the drawing-room. Iván Sergéyevitch
[Tourgénef] is having breakfast in the study.'
During Fet's visit of an hour's duration, he and his host
had to converse in low tones for fear of waking Tolstoy.
'He is like this all the time,' said Tourgénef. 'He came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
back from his Sevastopol battery; put up here, and is going
the pace. Sprees, gipsy-girls and cards all night long&mdash;and
then he sleeps like a corpse till two in the afternoon.
At first I tried to put the break on, but now I've given it
up, and let him do as he likes.'</p>

<p>Fet tells us that as soon as he met Tolstoy he noticed
his instinctive defiance of all accepted opinions; and at
Nekrásof's lodgings, the first time he saw Tolstoy and
Tourgénef together, he witnessed the desperation to which
the former reduced the latter by his biting retorts.</p>

<p class="i2">'I can't admit,' said Tolstoy, 'that what you say expresses
your convictions. If I stand at the door with a dagger or a
sword, and say, "While I am alive no one shall enter here,"
that shows conviction. But you, here, try to conceal the true
inwardness of your thoughts from one another, and call <i>that</i>
conviction!'</p>

<p class="i2">'Why do you come here?' squeaked Tourgénef, panting, his
voice rising to a falsetto (as always happened when he was
disputing). 'Your banner is not here! Go! Go to the salon
of Princess B&mdash;&mdash;!'</p>

<p class="i2">'Why should I ask you, where I am to go? Besides, empty
talk won't become conviction, merely because I am, or am not
here,' replied Tolstoy.</p>

<p>Though he cared little for politics, Fet's sympathies
inclined to the Conservative side, and he found himself in
accord with Tolstoy rather than with Tourgénef and the
other Contemporarians; but Fet's stay in Petersburg at
this time was a short one, and he therefore saw little
of Tolstoy. D. V. Grigoróvitch, the novelist, however,
reported to him another scene which also occurred at
Nekrásof's lodging.</p>

<p class="i2">You can't imagine what it was like! Great Heavens!
said Grigoróvitch. Tourgénef squeaked and squeaked, holding
his hand to his throat, and with the eyes of a dying gazelle
whispered: 'I can stand no more! I have bronchitis!' and
began walking to and fro through the three rooms.&mdash;'Bronchitis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is an imaginary illness,' growls Tolstoy after him: 'Bronchitis
is a metal!'</p>

<p class="i2">Of course Nekrásof's heart sank: he feared to lose either
of these valuable contributors to the <i>Contemporary</i>. We were
all agitated, and at our wits' end to know what to say.
Tolstoy, in the middle room, lay sulking on the morocco sofa;
while Tourgénef, spreading the tails of his short coat and with
his hands in his pockets, strode to and fro through the three
rooms. To avert a catastrophe, I went to the sofa and said,
'Tolstoy, old chap, don't get excited! You don't know how
he esteems and loves you!'</p>

<p class="i2">'I won't allow him to do anything to spite me!' exclaimed
Tolstoy with dilated nostrils. 'There! Now he keeps marching
past me on purpose, wagging his democratic haunches!'</p>

<p>The rest of the evidence is of much the same nature.
Of desire to agree, there was hardly a trace in Tolstoy,
who never doubted his own sincerity and seldom credited
that quality to others. The aristocratic influences that
surrounded his upbringing never induced him to be lenient
to men of his own class, such as Tourgénef; but they led
him to judge harshly and unsympathetically new men who
were pushing their way to the front by their own ability.
Fet, in his <i>Mémoires</i>, speaks with regret of the fact that
the educated classes ('the Intelligents') attracted by
Liberal ideas which made for the Emancipation of the
serfs, formed so strong a current of opinion that even the
literature produced by the nobility (and he claims that
the nobles supplied all the truly artistic literature)
advocated changes which struck at the root of the most
fundamental privileges of their class. This tendency, he
tells us, revolted 'Tolstoy's fresh, unwarped instinct.'</p>

<p>Grigoróvitch, in his <i>Literary Memoirs</i>, tells us that,
knowing how out of sympathy Tolstoy was with Petersburg,
and how evident it was that everything in
Petersburg irritated him, he was surprised to find that
the latter took permanent lodgings there. Grigoróvitch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
himself a Contemporarian, had met Tolstoy in Moscow,
and coming across him again in Petersburg, and hearing
that he was invited to dine with the staff of the <i>Contemporary</i>,
but did not yet know any of the members
intimately, agreed to accompany him.</p>

<p class="i2">On the way I warned him to be on his guard about certain
matters, and especially to avoid attacking George Sand,
whom he much disliked, but who was devoutly worshipped by
many Contemporarians. The dinner passed off all right,
Tolstoy being rather quiet at first, but at last he broke out.
Some one praised George Sand's new novel, and he abruptly
declared his hatred of her, adding that the heroines of the
novels she was then writing, if they really existed, ought to be
tied to the hangman's cart and driven through the streets
of Petersburg. He had, adds Grigoróvitch, already then
developed that peculiar view of women and of the woman-question,
which he afterwards expressed so vividly in <i>Anna
Karénina</i>.</p>

<p>With all the curious convolutions of Tolstoy's character,
there is a remarkable tenacity of conviction running
through his whole life, and a remark in <i>Resurrection</i>,
written nearly half a century later, throws a flood of
light on the fact of his so detesting George Sand's
emancipated heroines while he was himself living a loose life.
In that book, the hero has been attracted as well as repelled
first by Mariette, the General's wife, and then by a handsome
demi-mondaine he passes in the street, and this is
his reflection:</p>

<p class="i2">The animalism of the brute nature in man is disgusting,
thought he; but as long as it remains in its naked form we
observe it from the height of our spiritual life and despise it;
and, <i>whether one has fallen or resisted</i>, one remains what one was
before. But when that same animalism hides under a cloak of
poetry and esthetic feeling, and demands our worship&mdash;then we
are swallowed up by it completely, and worship animalism, no
longer distinguishing good from evil. Then it is awful!</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Grigoróvitch in another place speaks of Tolstoy's
'readiness to contradict.' It did not matter what opinion
was being expressed; and the more authoritative the
speaker appeared to be, the more eager was Tolstoy to
oppose him and to begin a verbal duel. 'Watching how
he listened to the speaker and pierced him with his eyes,
and noticing how ironically he pressed his lips together,
one conjectured that he was preparing not a direct reply,
but such an expression of opinion as would perplex his
opponent by its unexpectedness.'</p>

<p>Danílevsky, the novelist, confirms this impression of
Tolstoy's eagerness to oppose. They met at the house of a
well-known sculptor. Tolstoy entered the drawing-room
while a new work of Herzen's was being read aloud, and
quietly took up a position behind the reader's chair.
When the reading was over, he began, at first gently and
with restraint, then hotly and boldly, to attack Herzen
and the enthusiasm then current for his revolutionary and
emancipatory works; and he spoke so convincingly and
with such sincerity, that Danílevsky says he never afterwards
saw one of Herzen's publications in that house.</p>

<p>Tourgénef once said: 'In Tolstoy the character which
afterwards lay at the base of his whole outlook on life
early made itself manifest. He never believed in people's
sincerity. Every spiritual movement seemed to him false,
and he used to pierce those on whom his suspicion fell
with his extraordinarily penetrating eyes'; and Tourgénef
went on to say that personally he had never encountered
anything more disconcerting than that inquisitorial look,
which, accompanied by two or three biting words, was enough
to goad to fury any man who lacked strong self control.</p>

<p>The different sides of men's characters do not always
advance simultaneously or harmoniously; and it frequently
happens that those awakening to a sense of public duty
remain self-indulgent in respect to wine or women, while
others become abstainers or respectable husbands while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
remaining oblivious of the political duties they owe to the
community. Among the reformers whose acquaintance
Tolstoy made in Petersburg, there was unfortunately a
great deal of gluttony, drinking, gambling and loose
living, and Tolstoy&mdash;though he was often remorseful and
repentant about his own excesses with wine, women, and
cards&mdash;with his innate propensity for demanding <i>all or
nothing</i>, bitterly resented this in others. He would no
doubt have considered it hypocritical had he himself
come forward as a reformer before obtaining mastery over
his own appetites, and he judged others by the same
standard.</p>

<p>The ill success of the Crimean war had dealt a blow to
the prestige of the Tsardom, and a series of wide-reaching
reforms were being prepared at this time&mdash;among which the
most important were the abolition of serfdom, the reform
of civil and criminal law, the introduction of trial by jury
and of oral proceedings in the law courts, the establishment
of a system of Local Government somewhat resembling
our County Councils, and some relaxation of the insensate
severity of the press censorship. But though Tolstoy
reached Petersburg at a moment when Russia was entering
on this hopeful and fruitful period of internal reform,
neither in his published writings nor in any private
utterance we know of, does he express much sympathy
with those reforms, or show any perception of the
advantage that accrues to a nation whose inhabitants
interest themselves in public affairs. He never realised
that even if a people make for themselves bad laws, the
very fact of being invited to think about large practical
matters, and being allowed to test their own conclusions
in practice, fosters a habit of not fearing to think and to
act in accord with one's thought; and that this habit of
applying thought to the guidance of practical affairs,
overflows into a nation's commerce and industry and
agriculture, and ultimately causes the difference between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the comparative material security of our Western world
and the chronic fear of famine that oppresses many Eastern
lands.</p>

<p>But complex problems of public policy&mdash;which are
always difficult, and call for patience, tolerant co-operation,
and a willingness to accept half-loaves when whole ones
are unobtainable&mdash;never were to Tolstoy's taste. He
hankers after simple, clear-cut solutions, such as are obtainable
only subjectively, in the mind.</p>

<p>A few years later than the time of which we are speaking,
Tolstoy commenced a novel called <i>The Decembrists</i>,
which begins with a description of these reform years.
The passage shows how scornfully he regarded the whole
movement for the liberation of the people and the
democratisation of their institutions. These are his
words:</p>

<p class="i2">This happened not long ago, in the reign of Alexander II,
in our times of civilisation, progress, <i>problems</i>, re-birth of Russia,
etc. etc.; the time when the victorious Russian army returned
from Sevastopol which it had surrendered to the enemy; when
all Russia was celebrating the destruction of the Black Sea
fleet; and white-walled Moscow greeted, and congratulated on
that auspicious event, the remainder of the crews of that fleet,
offering them a good old Russian goblet of vódka, and in the
good old Russian way bringing them bread and salt and bowing
at their feet. This was the time when Russia, in the person
of her far-sighted virgin politicians, wept over the destruction
of her dream of a Te Deum in the Cathedral of St. Sophia, and
the deep-felt loss to the fatherland of two great men who had
perished during the war (one who, carried away by impatience
to hear the Te Deum referred to above, had fallen on the fields
of Wallachia, not without leaving there two squadrons of
Hussars; and the other an invaluable man who distributed
tea, other people's money, and sheets, to the wounded
without stealing any of them); in that time when from all
sides, in all departments of human activity in Russia, great
men sprang up like mushrooms: commanders, administrators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
economists, writers, orators, and simply great men without any
special calling or aim; in that time when at the Jubilee of a
Moscow actor, public opinion, fortified by a toast, appeared and
began to punish all wrongdoers; when stern Commissioners
galloped from Petersburg to the South and captured, exposed,
and punished the commissariat rascals; when in all the towns
dinners with toasts were given to the heroes of Sevastopol, and
to those of them whose arms and legs had been torn off, coppers
were given by those who met them on the bridges or highways;
at that time when oratorical talents were so rapidly developed
among the people that one publican everywhere and on all
occasions wrote, printed, and repeated by heart at dinners,
such powerful speeches that the guardians of order were obliged
to undertake repressive measures to subdue his eloquence;
when even in the English Club in Moscow a special room was
set apart for the consideration of public affairs; when periodicals
appeared under the most varied banners; journals developing
European principles on a European basis but with a Russian
world-conception, and journals on an exclusively Russian basis,
developing Russian principles but with a European world-conception;
when suddenly, so many journals appeared that it seemed
as if all possible titles had been used up: 'The Messenger,' 'The
Word,' 'The Discourse,' 'The Eagle,' and many others; when
nevertheless fresh titles presented themselves continually; at that
time when pleiades of new author-philosophers appeared, proving
that Science is national and is not national and is international,
and so on: and pleiades of writer-artists, who described woods
and sun-rises, and thunders, and the love of a Russian maiden,
and the idleness of one official, and the misconduct of many
officials; at that time when from all sides appeared problems
(as in the year '56 every concourse of circumstances was called
of which nobody could make head or tail); the problem of the
Cadet Schools, the Universities, the Censor, oral tribunals,
finance, the banks, the police, the Emancipation, and many
others; everybody still tried to discover new questions, and
everybody tried to solve them; they wrote, and read, and
talked, and drew up projects, and all wished to amend, destroy
and alter, and all Russians, as one man, were in an indescribable
state of enthusiasm. That was a condition which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
occurred twice in Russia in the nineteenth century: the first
time was in the year '12 when we thrashed Napoleon I, and
the second time was in '56 when Napoleon III thrashed us.
Great, unforgettable epoch of the re-birth of the Russian
people! Like the Frenchman who said that he had not lived
at all who had not lived during the Great French Revolution,
so I make bold to say that he who did not live in Russia in '56,
does not know what life is. The writer of these lines not
merely lived at that time, but was one of the workers of that
period. Not merely did he personally sit for some weeks in
one of the casemates of Sevastopol, but he wrote a work about
the Crimean War which brought him great fame, and in which
he clearly and minutely described how the soldiers in the
bastion fired off their muskets, how in the hospitals people were
bound up with bandages, and how in the cemetery they were
buried in the earth.</p>

<p class="i2">Having performed these exploits, the writer of these lines
arrived at the heart of the Empire, at a rocket-station, where
he reaped his laurels. He witnessed the enthusiasm of both
capitals and of the whole people, and experienced in his own
person how Russia can reward real service. The great ones
of the earth sought his acquaintance, pressed his hands, offered
him dinners, persistently invited him to come and see them,
and in order to hear from him particulars about the war,
narrated to him their own sensations. Therefore the writer of
these lines knows how to appreciate that great and memorable
time. But that is not what I want to tell about.</p>

<p>The very day he reached Petersburg from Sevastopol, in
September 1855, Tolstoy called on Tourgénef, who pressed
him to stay with him and introduced him to all that was
most interesting in Petersburg literary and artistic circles,
watching over his interests 'like an old nurse,' as Tourgénef
himself once expressed it. Tourgénef fully appreciated
Tolstoy's artistic genius, but was strangely blind to the
specially Tolstoyan side of Tolstoy's complex nature. As
we have already seen, friction soon arose between the two
men, and though they again and again made friends, their
friendship was very unstable and easily upset.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3>1856</h3>

<p>Early in 1856 Tolstoy's third brother, Demetrius, died
in Orél. His history has been told in Chapter II. Tolstoy
says: 'I was particularly horrid at that time. I
went to Orél from Petersburg, where I frequented
society and was filled with conceit. I felt sorry for Mítenka,
but not very sorry. I paid him a hurried visit, but did not
stay at Orél, and my brother died a few days after I left.'
On 2nd February the news reached Leo; but he says: 'I
really believe that what hurt me most, was that it prevented
my taking part in some private theatricals then being got
up at Court, and to which I had been invited.'</p>

<p>In March the war ended, and Tolstoy obtained furlough.
On 25th March he wrote to his brother Sergius:</p>

<p class="i2">I want to go abroad for eight months, and if they give me
leave I shall do so. I wrote to Nikólenka about it, and asked
him to come too. If we could all three arrange to go together
it would be first-rate. If each of us took Rs. 1000, we could
do the trip capitally.</p>

<p class="i2">Please write and tell me how you like <i>The Snow Storm</i>. I
am dissatisfied with it&mdash;seriously. But I now want to write
many things, only I positively have no time in this damned
Petersburg. Anyway, whether they let me go abroad or not,
I intend to take furlough in April and come to the country.</p>

<p>On 13th May he was still in Petersburg, and we find
him noting in his Diary:</p>

<p class="i2">The powerful means to true happiness in life, is to let flow
from oneself on all sides, without any laws, like a spider, a
cobweb of love, and to catch in it all that comes to hand:
women old or young, children, or policemen.</p>

<p>Among his literary acquaintances at this time the one
for whom he seems to have felt most sympathy and respect
was Drouzhínin, a critic, writer of stories, and translator of
Shakespear. Before long we find Drouzhínin leading a
revolt against the <i>Contemporary</i> and attracting some of the
contributors to the <i>Reading Library</i>, a rival magazine, to
which Tolstoy contributed an article in December 1856.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
It was not till the end of May that he got away from
Petersburg; and on his road home he stopped in Moscow
and visited the family of Dr. Behrs, a Russian of German
origin, who had married Miss Islényef. The first mention
one gets of Tolstoy's future wife is a note in his Diary
relating to this visit to the Behrs's country house near
Moscow. He says: 'The children served us. What dear,
merry little girls! Little more than six years later, the
second of these 'merry little girls' was Countess Tolstoy!</p>

<p>Three days later he writes to his brother Sergius: 'I
spent ten days in Moscow ... very pleasantly, without
champagne or gipsies, but a little in love&mdash;I will tell you
later on with whom.' The object of his affection at that
time was of course not Dr. Behrs's twelve-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>From Yásnaya he made a round of visits to see his
married sister and other neighbours; among them Tourgénef,
at whose house a gathering of the Tolstoys took place.
Special honour was paid to Leo, who comically posed as the
hero of a Triumph. He was being crowned and almost
covered with flowers, leaves, grass, and anything that came
handy, when the approach of an unwelcome guest&mdash;a lady
neighbour of Tourgénef's&mdash;was announced. Thereupon
the host seized his head in despair; the triumpher, with a
howl, began to turn rapid catherine-wheel somersaults
through the rooms; and his sister's husband was quickly
bandaged up as an invalid, to be used as an excuse and a
protection from the unwelcome intruder.</p>

<p>The letter to Sergius, quoted above, contains an allusion
to Tolstoy's first serious matrimonial project.</p>

<p>He had in childhood been much attached to a certain
Sónitchka Kalóshina. While at the University, he had
had a sentimental love affair with a certain Z. M., who
seems hardly to have been aware of his devotion. Then
there was the Cossack damsel who figures in <i>The Cossacks</i>,
and subsequently he much admired a society lady, Madame
Sch., who may also have been scarcely aware of his feelings,
for Tolstoy was shy and timid in these matters&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
were quite different from his affairs with gipsy girls and
other hireable women.</p>

<p>The present affair with V. V. A. was more serious than
any of its predecessors. It led to a long correspondence,
and even to their engagement being announced among
relations and friends. The lady was the good-looking
daughter of a landowner in the neighbourhood of Yásnaya
Polyána.</p>

<p>In August she accompanied her family to Moscow for
the Coronation of Alexander II. At these festivities
she enjoyed herself greatly, and described her feelings
in a letter which dealt the first blow to Tolstoy's
admiration. He at once assumed towards her the rôle
which more than twenty-five years later he assumed towards
mankind in general, and upbraided her with the
insignificant and unworthy nature of her interests and
enjoyments, besides indulging in scathing sarcasms about
the fashionable circles with which she was so enraptured.</p>

<p>The young lady did not reply. Tolstoy then begged
pardon&mdash;which was granted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had fallen ill; and early in September
he wrote to his brother Sergius:</p>

<p class="i2">Only now, at nine o'clock on Monday evening, can I give you
a satisfactory reply, for till now things went worse and worse.
Two doctors were sent for, and administered another forty
leeches, but only now have I had a good sleep and, on waking
up, feel considerably better. All the same, there can be no
question of my leaving home for five or six days yet. So
<i>au revoir</i>; please let me know when you go (shooting) and
whether it is true that your farming has been seriously
neglected; and do not kill all the game without me. I will
send the dogs, perhaps, to-morrow.</p>

<p>He recovered. The young lady returned to her family's
estate at Soudakóva, and his visits being renewed, Tolstoy's
intimacy with her continued and grew closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Yet to 'test himself,' he started for a visit to Petersburg,
and as soon as he had got as far as Moscow, wrote a letter
to the young lady in which he dwelt on the importance of
the mutual attraction of the sexes, the serious nature of
his and her relation to one another, and the necessity of
testing themselves by time and distance.</p>

<p>While living in Petersburg, he learnt the particulars of
a flirtation the young lady had carried on at the time of
the Coronation with a French music-master, Mortier; and
he wrote her a letter full of reproaches. Instead of posting
it, however, he wrote her another&mdash;telling her of the
one he had written, which he intended to show her when
they met.</p>

<p>After once breaking off relations with Mortier, the young
lady allowed them to be again renewed, and what Tolstoy
learned of the matter caused him seriously to reconsider
his position. For some time his feelings evidently wavered.
The very day after posting his remonstrance, he wrote
another letter in a conciliatory tone, and though no reply
came, he assumed that all was well, and continued the
correspondence by sending her a detailed plan of the life
they might hope to live together: its surroundings, circle
of acquaintance, and the arrangement of their time. He
also tried to interest her in the most serious problems of
life.</p>

<p>No answer reaching him for a long time, he became
agitated and perplexed. Then several letters, delayed in
the post, arrived all at once, and cordial intercourse was
re-established between the lovers. But though the
engagement and correspondence continued, and expressions
of affection were interchanged, it gradually became
more and more evident that there was something artificial
and unsatisfactory in their relation to one another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tolstoy was having other difficulties in
Petersburg. On 10th November 1856 he writes to his
brother Sergius:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Forgive me, dear friend Seryózha, for only writing two words&mdash;I
have no time for more. I have been most unlucky since I
left home; there is no one here I like. It seems that I have
been abused in the <i>Fatherland Journal</i> for my war stories&mdash;I
have not yet read the attack; but the worst is that Konstantínof
[the General under whose command was the battery to
which Tolstoy was attached] informed me as soon as I got here
that the Grand Duke Michael, having learnt that I am supposed
to have composed the Soldiers' Song, is displeased, particularly
at my having (as rumour says) taught it to the soldiers. This
is abominable. I have had an explanation with the Head of
the Staff. The only satisfactory thing is that my health is
good, and that (Dr.) Schipoulínsky says my lungs are thoroughly
sound.</p>

<p>On 20th November 1856 Tolstoy left the army, in which
he had never secured promotion though he had private
influence enough to enable him, about this time, to save
from trial by Court Martial the Commander of the battery
in which he had served in the Crimea.</p>

<p>Early in December he left Petersburg for Moscow.
From there, on 5th December, he writes to Aunt
Tatiána:</p>

<p class="i2">When I first went away and for a week after, I thought I
was 'in love' as it is called; but with an imagination such as
mine that was not difficult.</p>

<p class="i2">Now, however, especially since I have set to work diligently,
I should like&mdash;and very much like&mdash;to be able to say that I
am in love, or even that I love her; but it is not the case.
The only feeling I have for her is gratitude for her love of me,
and the thought that of all the girls I have known or know, she
would have made me the best wife, as I understand family life.
And that is what I should like to have your candid opinion
about. Am I mistaken or not? I should like to hear your
advice because, in the first place, you know both her and me;
and chiefly because you love me, and those who love are never
wrong. It is true that I have tested myself very badly, for
from the time I left home I have led a solitary rather than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
dissipated life, and have seen few women; but notwithstanding
that, I have had many moments of vexation with myself for
having become connected with her, and I have repented of it.
All the same, I repeat that if I were convinced that she is of a
steadfast nature, and would love me always&mdash;even though not
as now, yet more than any one else&mdash;then I should not hesitate
for a moment about marrying her. I am confident that then
my love of her would increase more and more and that through
that feeling she would become a good woman.</p>

<div class="caption">
<span class="smcap">Tolstoy in 1856, the year he left the army.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The young lady in question visited Petersburg for part
of the winter season, but Tolstoy does not appear to have
met her there, being himself away in Moscow for several
weeks. The correspondence was largely didactic on his
side, and was so unsatisfactory to the young lady that she
finally forbade him to write again. He disobeyed the
injunction, asking her pardon, telling her he was going
abroad, and begging that she would write to him once
more, to an address in Paris.</p>

<p>He wrote to Aunt Tatiána from Moscow, on 12th January
1857, a letter in which Russian and French alternate.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><span class="smcap">Chère Tante!</span>&mdash;J'ai reçu mon passeport pour l'étranger et
je suis venu à Moscou pour y passer quelques jours avec Marie
arranger mes affaires et prendre congé de vous.</p>

<p class="i2">But now I have reconsidered the matter, especially on
Máshenka's advice, and have decided to remain with her here
a week or two and then to go straight through Warsaw to
Paris. You no doubt understand, <i>chère tante</i>, why I do not
wish and why it is not right for me to come now to Yásnaya,
or rather to Soudakóva. I, it seems, have acted very badly in
relation to V., but were I to see her now, I should behave still
worse. As I wrote you, I am more than indifferent to her, and
feel that I can no longer deceive either her or myself. But
were I to come, I might perhaps, from weakness of character,
again delude myself.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Vous rappelez-vous, chère tante, comme vous vous êtes
moquée de moi, quand je vous ai dit que je partais pour Pétersbourg
'pour m'éprouver,' et cependant c'est à cette idée que je
suis redevable de n'avoir pas fait le malheur de la jeune personne
et le mien, car ne croyez pas que ce soit de l'inconstance
ou de l'infidélité; personne ne m'a plu pendant ces deux mois,
mais tout bonnement j'ai vu que je me trompais moi-même;
que non seulement jamais je n'ai eu, mais jamais je n'aurais
pour V. le moindre sentiment d'amour véritable. La seule
chose qui me fait beaucoup de peine c'est que j'ai fait du tort
à la demoiselle et que je ne pourrai prendre congé de vous
avant de partir....</p>

<p>After reaching Paris (an event belonging properly
to the next chapter) he received a last communication
from V. V. A. and wrote her a friendly letter in
reply, speaking of his love as of something past,
thanking her for her friendship, and wishing her every
happiness.</p>

<p>His Aunt Tatiána&mdash;generally the mildest of critics
where he was concerned&mdash;appears to have blamed him for
his conduct; and the friends of V. V. A., including
a French governess, Mlle. Vergani, did so yet more
severely. In one of his letters, which contains indications
of an agitation too strong to allow him to
complete the construction of the opening sentence, he
says:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>Si Mlle. V. qui m'a écrit une lettre aussi ridicule, voulait
se rappeler toute ma conduite vis-à-vis de V. V. A., comment
je tâchais de venir le plus rarement possible, comment c'est
elle qui m'engageait à venir plus souvent et à entrer dans des
relations plus proches. Je comprends qu'elle soit fâchée de
ce qu'une chose qu'elle a beaucoup désirée ne s'est pas faite
(j'en suis fâché peut-être plus qu'elle) mais ce n'est pas une
raison pour dire à un homme qui s'est efforcé d'agir le mieux
possible, qui a fait des sacrifices de peur de faire le malheur
des autres, de lui dire, qu'il est un <i>pig</i> [this one word is in
Russian in the original] et de le faire accroire à tout le monde.
Je suis sûr que Toúla [the town nearest his estate] est convaincu
que je suis le plus grand des monstres.</p>

<p>Turning from love to literature and friendship, we have
two letters of this period from Tourgénef. The first is
dated Paris, 16th November 1856, and is as follows:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dearest Tolstoy</span>,&mdash;Your letter of 15 October took a whole
month crawling to me&mdash;I received it only yesterday. I have
thought carefully about what you write me&mdash;and I think you
are wrong. It is true I cannot be quite sincere, because I can't
be quite frank, with you. I think we got to know each other
awkwardly and at a bad time, and when we meet again it will
be much easier and smoother. I feel that I love you as a man
(as an author it needs no saying); but much in you is trying to
me, and ultimately I found it better to keep at a distance from
you. When we meet we will again try to go hand in hand&mdash;perhaps
we shall succeed better; for strange as it may sound,
my heart turns to you when at a distance, as to a brother:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
I even feel tenderly towards you. In a word, I love you&mdash;that
is certain; perchance from that, in time, all good will follow.
I heard of your illness and grieved; but now, I beg you, drive
the thought of it out of your head. For you too have your
fancies, and are perhaps thinking of consumption&mdash;but, God
knows, you have nothing of the sort....</p>

<p class="i2">You have finished the first part of <i>Youth</i>&mdash;that is capital.
How sorry I am to be unable to hear it read! If you do not go
astray (which I think there is no reason to anticipate) you will
go very far. I wish you good health, activity&mdash;and freedom,
spiritual freedom.</p>

<p class="i2">As to my <i>Faust</i>, I do not think it will please you very much.
My things could please you and perhaps have some influence on
you, only until you became independent. Now you have no
need to study me; you see only the difference of our manners,
the mistakes and the omissions; what you have to do is to
study man, your own heart, and the really great writers. I am
a writer of a transition period&mdash;and am of use only to men in
a transition state. So farewell, and be well. Write to me.</p>

<p>On 8th December 1856 he writes again:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Tolstoy</span>,&mdash;Yesterday my good genius led me past the
post-office, and it occurred to me to ask if there were any
letters for me at the <i>poste-restante</i> (though I think that all my
friends ought long ago to have learnt my Paris address) and
I found your letter, in which you speak of my <i>Faust</i>. You can
well imagine how glad I was to read it. Your sympathy
gladdened me truly and deeply. Yes, and from the whole
letter there breathes a mild, clear and friendly peacefulness.
It remains for me to hold out my hand across the 'ravine'
which has long since become a hardly perceptible crack, about
which we will speak no more&mdash;it is not worth it.</p>

<p class="i2">I fear to speak of one thing you mention: it is a delicate
matter,&mdash;words may blight such things before they are ripe,
but when they are ripe a hammer will not break them. God
grant that all may turn out favourably and well. It may bring
you that spiritual repose which you lacked when I knew you.</p>

<p class="i2">You have, I see, now become very intimate with Drouzhínin&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
are under his influence. That is right, only take care
not to swallow too much of him. When I was your age, only
men of enthusiastic natures influenced me; but you are built
differently, and perhaps also the times are changed.... Let
me know in which numbers of the <i>Contemporary</i> your <i>Youth</i> will
appear; and by the way, let me know the final impression
made on you by <i>Lear</i>, which you probably have read, if only for
Drouzhínin's sake.</p>

<p>About the same time Tourgénef wrote to Drouzhínin:</p>

<p class="i2">I hear that you have become very intimate with Tolstoy&mdash;and
he has become very pleasant and serene. I am very glad.
When that new wine has finished fermenting, it will yield
a drink fit for the Gods. What about his <i>Youth</i>, which was sent
for your verdict?</p>

<p>The allusion to Drouzhínin's translation of <i>King Lear</i>
is worth noticing because fully fifty years later it was this
play that Tolstoy selected for hostile analysis in his famous
attack on Shakespear. One gathers from a letter written
by V. P. Bótkin, that Drouzhínin's rendering impressed
Tolstoy favourably at the time.</p>

<p>Before quoting Drouzhínin's criticism of <i>Youth</i>, it will be
in place to mention other works by Tolstoy, not yet
enumerated, which appeared at this period. <i>Memoirs of a
Billiard Marker</i>, giving a glimpse of temptations Tolstoy
had experienced, was published in January 1855, while he
was in Sevastopol. In January 1856 came <i>Sevastopol in
August</i>. In March 1856 appeared <i>The Snow Storm</i>. In
May 1856 came a rollicking tale, with flashes of humour
like that of Charles Lever, entitled <i>Two Hussars</i>. It is
the only story Tolstoy ever wrote in that vein; and in it
are introduced gipsy singers such as those of whom repeated
mention occurs in his letters. In December, before he
went abroad, two more tales were published: one of these,
entitled <i>Meeting a Moscow Acquaintance in the Detachment</i>,
containing a scathing portrayal of the cowardice a man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who had passed muster in 'good society,' displayed when
circumstances put him to the test. The other story, <i>A
Squire's Morning</i>, is closely drawn from Tolstoy's own experience
when on first leaving the University he settled on
his estate and attempted to better the condition of his
serfs. Their stolidity, their distrust, and the immense
difficulty of introducing any changes, are all brought out.</p>

<p>In a letter to Drouzhínin, Tourgénef wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">I have read his <i>Squire's Morning</i>, which pleased me exceedingly
by its sincerity and almost complete freedom of outlook.
I say 'almost' because in the way he set himself the task,
there still is hidden (without his perhaps being aware of it)
a certain amount of prejudice. The chief moral impression
produced by the story (leaving the artistic impression aside)
is that so long as the state of serfdom exists, there is no
possibility of the two sides drawing together, despite the most
disinterested and honourable desire to do so; and this impression
is good and true. But beside it, like a horse cantering
beside a trotter, there is another: namely, that in general to
try to enlighten or improve the condition of the peasants leads
to nothing; and this impression is unpleasant. But the mastery
of language, the way it is told, and his character-drawing, are
grand.</p>


<h3>1857</h3>

<p>In January 1857 appeared <i>Youth</i>, the continuation
of <i>Childhood</i> and <i>Boyhood</i>.</p>

<p>How great Drouzhínin's influence was with Tolstoy at
this time, may be judged by the tone of his letter to
him, giving an opinion on <i>Youth</i>. He writes:</p>

<p class="i2">About <i>Youth</i> one ought to write twenty pages. I read it
with anger, with yells and with oaths&mdash;not on account of its
literary quality, but because of the quality of the notebooks in
which it is written, and the handwritings. The mixing of
two hands, a known and an unknown, diverted my attention
and hindered an intelligent perusal. It was as though two
voices shouted in my ear and purposely distracted my attention,
and I know that this has prevented my receiving an adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
impression. All the same I will say what I can. Your task
was a terrible one, and you have executed it very well. No
other writer of our day could have so seized and sketched the
agitated and disorderly period of youth. To those who are
developed, your <i>Youth</i> will furnish an immense pleasure; and
if any one tells you it is inferior to <i>Childhood</i> and <i>Boyhood</i> you
may spit in his physiognomy. There is a world of poetry in it&mdash;all
the first chapters are admirable; only the introduction is
dry till one reaches the description of spring.... In many
chapters one scents the poetic charm of old Moscow, which
no one has yet reproduced properly. Some chapters are dry
and long: for instance all the stipulations with Dmítry Nehlúdof.... The
conscription of Semyónof will not pass the
Censor.</p>

<p class="i2">Do not fear your reflections, they are all clever and original.
But you have an inclination to a super-refinement of analysis
which may become a great defect. You are sometimes on the
point of saying that so-and-so's thigh indicated that he wished
to travel in India. You must restrain this tendency, but do
not extinguish it on any account. All your work on your
analyses should be of the same kind. Each of your defects has
its share of strength and beauty, and almost every one of your
qualities carries with it the seed of a defect.</p>

<p class="i2">Your style quite accords with that conclusion: you are most
ungrammatical, sometimes with the lack of grammar of a
reformer and powerful poet reshaping a language his own way
and for ever, but sometimes with the lack of grammar of an
officer sitting in a casemate and writing to his chum. One can
say with assurance that all the pages you have written with
love are admirable,&mdash;but as soon as you grow cold, your words
become entangled, and diabolical forms of speech appear.
Therefore the parts written coldly should be revised and corrected.
I tried to straighten out some bits, but gave it up; it
is a work which only you can and must do. Above all, avoid
long sentences. Cut them up into two or three; do not be
sparing of full-stops.... Do not stand on ceremony with the
particles, and strike out by dozens the words: <i>which</i>, <i>who</i>, and
<i>that</i>. When in difficulties, take a sentence and imagine that
you want to say it to some one in a most conversational way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
As a translator I may testify that Tolstoy never fully
learned the lesson Drouzhínin here set him, and that to the
very last he continued occasionally to intermingle passages of
extraordinary simplicity and force with sentences that defy
analysis and abound in redundances.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty years later Tolstoy himself criticised the
subject-matter of <i>Childhood</i>, <i>Boyhood</i>, and <i>Youth</i> as
follows:</p>

<p class="i2">I have re-read them and regret that I wrote them; so ill,
artificially and insincerely are they penned. It could not be
otherwise: first, because what I aimed at was not to write my
own history but that of the friends of my youth, and this produced
an awkward mixture of the facts of their and my own
childhood; and secondly, because at the time I wrote it I was
far from being independent in my way of expressing myself,
being strongly influenced by two writers: Sterne (his <i>Sentimental
Journey</i>) and Töpffer (his <i>Bibliothèque de Mon Oncle</i>).</p>

<p class="i2">I am now specially dissatisfied with the two last parts. <i>Boyhood</i>
and <i>Youth</i>, in which besides an awkward mixture of truth
and invention, there is also insincerity: a desire to put forward
as good and important what I did not then consider good and
important, namely, my democratic tendency.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter it will be in place to
give a list of books Tolstoy mentions as having influenced
him after he left the University and before his marriage.
They were: Goethe's <i>Hermann und Dorothea</i>; Hugo's
<i>Notre Dame de Paris</i>; Plato's <i>Phaedo</i> and <i>Symposium</i> (in
Cousin's French translation); and the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> in
Russian versions. All these, he says, had a 'very great'
influence on him, while the poems of his compatriots,
Tútchef, Kóltsof, and his friend Fet, had 'great' influence.</p>

<p>He tells us that artistic talent in literature influenced
him more than any political or social tendency; and this is
quite in accord both with his highly artistic nature and
with his general apathy towards public affairs. There was
a Slavophil theory (built to justify things as they were)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
which proclaimed it natural for a Slavonic people to leave
the task of governing to its rulers, while retaining its
intellectual freedom to disapprove of what was done amiss;
and though Tolstoy never joined the Slavophils, this has
been very much his own attitude on the matter.</p>

<p>Even in early childhood he had appreciated some of
Poúshkin's poems, such as <i>To the Sea</i> and <i>To Napoleon</i>,
and had learned them by heart and recited them with
feeling; but curiously enough it was the perusal of
Mérimée's French prose translation of Poúshkin's <i>Gipsies</i>
that, after he was grown up, aroused Tolstoy's keen admiration
of Poúshkin's mastery of clear, simple, direct language.
Later in life Tolstoy used to say that Poúshkin's prose
stories, such as <i>The Captain's Daughter</i>, are his best works;
but he never lost his appreciation of Poúshkin's power of
expression in verse. In his Diary (4th January 1857) he
wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">I dined at Bótkin's with Panáef alone; he read me Poúshkin;
I went into Bótkin's study and wrote a letter to Tourgénef, and
then I sat down on the sofa and wept causeless but blissful
tears. I am positively happy all this time, intoxicated with the
rapidity of my moral progress.</p>

<p>Despite his headstrong outbursts and many vacillations,
he seems to have been always a welcome guest in almost
any society he cared to frequent, and none of his critics has
spoken as harshly of him as he speaks of himself when
describing these</p>

<p class="i2">terrible twenty years of coarse dissipation, the service of
ambition, vanity, and above all of lust.... It is true that not
all my life was so terribly bad as this twenty-year period from
fourteen to thirty-four; and it is true that even that period of
my life was not the continuous evil that during a recent illness
it appeared to me to be. Even during those years, strivings
towards goodness awoke in me, though they did not last long,
and were soon choked by passions nothing could restrain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
In his <i>Confession</i>, written more than twenty years later,
when speaking of his religious beliefs at this time, Tolstoy
tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">With all my soul I wished to be good; but I was young,
passionate, and alone, completely alone when I sought goodness.
Every time I tried to express my most sincere desire,
namely, to be morally good, I met with contempt and ridicule;
but as soon as I yielded to nasty passions I was praised and
encouraged.</p>

<p class="i2">Ambition, love of power, covetousness, lasciviousness, pride,
anger and revenge&mdash;were all respected.... I cannot think of
those years without horror, loathing and heartache. I killed
men in war, and challenged men to duels in order to kill them;
I lost at cards, consumed the labour of the peasants, sentenced
them to punishments, lived loosely and deceived people. Lying,
robbery, adultery of all kinds, drunkenness, violence, murder&mdash;there
was no crime I did not commit, and people approved of
my conduct, and my contemporaries considered and consider
me to be a comparatively moral man.</p>

<p class="i2">So I lived for ten years.</p>

<p class="i2">During that time I began to write from vanity, covetousness
and pride. In my writings I did the same as in my life. To
get fame and money, for the sake of which I wrote, it was
necessary to hide the good and to show the evil. And I did so.
How often in my writings did I contrive to hide under the
guise of indifference or even of banter, those strivings of mine
towards goodness, which gave meaning to my life! And I
succeeded in this, and was praised.</p>

<p class="i2">At twenty-six years of age<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> I returned to Petersburg after
the war, and met the writers. They received me as one of
themselves and flattered me. And before I had time to look
round I had adopted the class views on life of the authors
I had come among, and these views completely obliterated all
my former strivings to improve. Those views furnished a
theory which justified the dissoluteness of my life. The view
of life of these people, my comrades in authorship, consisted
in this: that life in general goes on developing, and in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
development we&mdash;men of thought&mdash;have the chief part; and
among men of thought it is we&mdash;artists and poets&mdash;who have
the chief influence. Our vocation is to teach mankind. And
lest the simple question should suggest itself: What do I
know, and what can I teach? it is explained in this theory
that this need not be known, and that the artist and poet
teach unconsciously. I was considered an admirable artist and
poet, and therefore it was very natural for me to adopt this
theory. I, artist and poet, wrote and taught, without myself
knowing what. For this I was paid money; I had excellent
food, lodging, women and society; and I had fame, which
showed that what I taught was very good.</p>

<p class="i2">This faith in the meaning of poetry and in the development
of life, was a religion, and I was one of its priests. To be
its priest was very pleasant and profitable. And I lived a
considerable time in this faith without doubting its validity.
But in the second, and especially in the third year of this life,
I began to doubt the infallibility of this religion and to examine
it. My first cause of doubt was that I began to notice that
the priests of this religion were not all in accord among themselves.
Some said: We are the best and most useful teachers;
we teach what is wanted, but the others teach wrongly. Others
said: No! we are the real teachers, and you teach wrongly.
And they disputed, quarrelled, abused one another, cheated,
and tricked one another. There were also many among them
who did not care who was right and who was wrong, but were
simply bent on attaining their covetous aims by means of this
activity of ours. All this obliged me to doubt the validity of
our creed.</p>

<p class="i2">Moreover, having begun to doubt the truth of the authors'
creed itself, I also began to observe its priests more attentively,
and I became convinced that almost all the priests of that
religion, the writers, were immoral, and for the most part men
of bad, worthless character, much inferior to those whom I had
met in my former dissipated and military life; but they were
self-confident and self-assured as only those can be who are
quite holy or who do not know what holiness is. These people
revolted me, and I became revolting to myself, and I realised
that that faith is a fraud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p class="i2">But strange to say, though I understood this fraud and
renounced it, yet I did not renounce the rank these people
gave me: the rank of artist, poet, and teacher. I naïvely
imagined that I was a poet and artist and could teach everybody
without myself knowing what I was teaching, and I acted
on that assumption.</p>

<p class="i2">From my intimacy with these men I acquired a new vice:
abnormally developed pride, and an insane assurance that it was
my vocation to teach men, without knowing what.</p>

<p class="i2">To remember that time, and my own state of mind and
that of those men (though there are thousands like them
to-day) is sad and terrible and ludicrous, and arouses exactly
the feeling one experiences in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p class="i2">We were all then convinced that it was necessary for us to
speak, write, and print as quickly as possible and as much as possible,
and that it was all wanted for the good of humanity. And
thousands of us, contradicting and abusing one another, all
printed and wrote&mdash;teaching others. And without remarking
that we knew nothing, and that to the simplest of life's questions:
What is good and what is evil? we did not know how
to reply, we all, not listening to one another, talked at the
same time, sometimes backing and praising one another in
order to be backed and praised in turn, sometimes getting
angry with one another&mdash;just as in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p class="i2">Thousands of workmen laboured to the extreme limit of their
strength day and night setting the type and printing millions
of words which the post carried all over Russia, and we still
went on teaching and could nohow find time to teach enough,
and were always angry that sufficient attention was not paid
to us.</p>

<p class="i2">It was terribly strange, but is now quite comprehensible.
Our real innermost consideration was, that we wanted to get as
much money and praise as possible. To gain this end we could
do nothing except write books and papers. So we did that.
But in order to do such useless work and feel assured that we
were very important people, we required a theory justifying our
activity. And so among us this theory was devised: 'All that
exists develops. And it all develops by means of Culture.
And Culture is measured by the circulation of books and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
newspapers. And we are paid money and are respected
because we write books and newspapers, and therefore we are
the most useful and the best of men.' This theory would have
been all very well if we had been unanimous, but as every
thought expressed by one of us was always met by a diametrically
opposed thought expressed by some one else, we ought to have
been driven to reflection. But we ignored this; people paid us
money, and those on our side praised us; so each one of us
considered himself justified.</p>

<h3>1857</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> he took part in the Turkish war in 1854, Tolstoy
has only twice been out of Russia. The first time was at
the period we have now reached. On 10th February
1857 (new style) he left Moscow by post-chaise
for Warsaw, from whence a railway already ran
westward. He reached Paris on 21st February. There
he met Tourgénef and Nekrásof, with the former of whom
he was still unable to get on smoothly. Tourgénef writes:
'With Tolstoy I still cannot become quite intimate; we
see things too differently'; and in some moment of anger
Tolstoy even challenged his fellow-writer to a duel.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Nekrásof appears to have patched matters up, and in
March Tolstoy and Tourgénef went to Dijon together,
and spent some days there. During this trip Tolstoy
commenced his story <i>Albert</i>, founded on his experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with the talented but drunken musician Rudolf, already
mentioned in Chapter III. After he had returned to Paris,
he was present at an execution, and made the following
jotting in his Diary:</p>

<p class="i2">I rose at seven o'clock and drove to see an execution. A
stout, white, healthy neck and breast: he kissed the Gospels,
and then&mdash;Death. How senseless.... I have not received
this strong impression for naught. I am not a man of politics.
Morals and art I know, love, and can (deal with). The
guillotine long prevented my sleeping and obliged me to
reflect.</p>

<p>Tolstoy has a gift of telling the essential truth in few
words, and never did he sum himself up better than in the
sentences, 'I am not a man of politics. Morals and art I
know, love, and can.' There is hardly any possible room
for doubt about the second sentence, and there is certainly
none about the first, as his whole life shows.</p>

<p>Many years later, he wrote of this event in his <i>Confession</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">When I saw the head separate from the body, and how they
both thumped into the box at the same moment, I understood,
not with my mind but with my whole being, that no theory of
the reasonableness of our present progress can justify this deed;
and that though everybody from the creation of the world, on
whatever theory, had held it to be necessary, I know it to be
unnecessary and bad; and therefore the arbiter of what is good
and evil is not what people say and do, and is not progress, but
is my heart and I.</p>

<p>It was probably during this visit to Paris that Tolstoy
witnessed and admired Chevet's popularisation of music by
an easy system of instruction, of which he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have seen hundreds of horny-handed working men sitting
on benches (under which lay the tool-bags they brought from
their work) singing at sight, and understanding and being
interested in the laws of music.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
This experience he utilised later on in his school at
Yásnaya.</p>

<p>In spring he went to Switzerland, and from Geneva he
wrote to his Aunt Tatiána:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>J'ai passé un mois et demi à Paris, et si agréablement que
tous les jours je me suis dit, que j'ai bien fait de venir à
l'étranger. Je suis très peu allé ni dans la société, ni dans le
monde littéraire, ni dans le monde des cafés et des bals publics,
mais malgré cela j'ai trouvé ici tant de choses nouvelles et
intéressantes pour moi, que tous les jours, en me couchant, je
me dis, quel dommage que la journée est passée si vite; je
n'ai même pas eu le temps de travailler, ce que je me proposais
de faire.</p>

<p class="i2">Le pauvre Turgenef est très malade physiquement et encore
plus moralement. Sa malheureuse liaison avec Madame Viardot,
et sa fille, le retiennent ici dans un climat qui lui est pernicieux
et il fait pitié de voir. Je n'aurais jamais cru qu'il put aimer
ainsi.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's friends Drouzhínin and V. P. Bótkin visited
Geneva at this time, and they all three went on a walking
tour into Piedmont together. After that he settled at
Clarens on the lake of Geneva, from whence he again
wrote to Aunt Tatiána:</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>18 Mai 1857.</i></p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>Je viens de recevoir votre lettre, chère tante, qui m'a trouvée
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
comme vous devez le savoir d'après ma dernière lettre, aux
environs de Genève à Clarens dans ce même village, où a
demeuré la Julia de Rousseau.... Je n'essaierai pas de vous
depeindre la beauté de ce pays, surtout à présent, quand tout
est en feuilles et en fleurs; je vous dirai seulement, qu'à la
lettre il est impossible de se détacher de ce lac et de ces
rivages et que je passe la plus grande partie de mon temps à
regarder et à admirer en me promenant, ou bien en me mettant
seulement à la fenêtre de ma chambre.</p>

<p class="i2">Je ne cesse de me féliciter de l'idée que j'ai eu de quitter
Paris et de venir passer le printemps ici, quoique cela m'ait
mérité de votre part le reproche d'inconstance. Vraiment, je
suis heureux, and begin to feel the advantage of having been
born with a caul.</p>

<p class="i2">Il y a ici société charmante de russes: les Poúshkins, the
Karamzíns and the Mestchérskys; and they have all, Heaven
knows why, taken to liking me; I feel it, and the month I have
spent here I have been so nice and good and cosy, that I am
sad at the thought of leaving.</p>

<p>From Clarens he took steamer to Montreux, and from
there went on foot, taking with him as companion a ten-year-old
lad named Sásha, the son of some Russians whose
acquaintance he had made at Clarens. They crossed the
Pass of Jamon and, after changing their minds as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
direction they would take, finally made for Château d'Oex,
from whence they proceeded by <i>diligence</i> to Thun. From
that town Tolstoy went on to Lucerne, which he reached
in July 1857.</p>

<p>Again and again in his Diary and letters Tolstoy's
vivid delight in Nature shows itself in descriptions of the
scenery: 'It is wonderful,' he writes, 'but I was at Clarens
for two months, and every time&mdash;when in the morning,
and especially after dinner towards evening&mdash;I opened the
shutters on which the shadows were already falling, and
glanced at the lake and the distant blue of the mountains
reflected in it, the beauty blinded me and acted on me
with the force of a surprise.' But together with this keen
appreciation, comes now and then a sort of protest that
this grandiose Swiss mountain scenery is, after all, not the
Nature that most appeals to him&mdash;a yearning for the vast
steppes and forests of his native land. After ascending
the Pass of Jamon and describing the magnificent scenery
and the pleasure of the climb, he adds:</p>

<p class="i2">It was something beautiful, even unusually beautiful, but I do
not love what are called magnificent and remarkable views:
they are, as it were, cold.... I love Nature when, though it
surrounds me on all sides and extends unendingly, I am part of
it. I love it, when on all sides I am surrounded by hot air, and
that same air rolls away to unending distance, and those same
sappy leaves of grass which I crush as I sit on them, form the
green of the boundless meadows; when those same leaves
which, fluttering in the wind, run their shadows across my face,
form also the dark blue of the distant forests; while the same
air one breathes makes the deep, light blue of the immeasurable
sky; when you do not exult and rejoice alone in Nature,
but when around you myriads of insects buzz and whirl, and
beetles, clinging together, creep about, and all around you
birds overflow with song.</p>

<p class="i2">But this is bare, cold, desolate, grey plateau; and somewhere
afar there is something beautiful veiled with mist. But that
something is so distant that I do not feel the chief delight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Nature&mdash;do not feel myself a part of that endless and beautiful
distance: it is foreign to me.</p>

<p>From Lucerne he writes:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>Je suis de nouveau tout seul, et je vous avouerai que très
souvent la solitude m'est pénible, car les connaissances qu'on
fait dans les hôtels et en chemin de fer ne sont pas des
ressources; mais cet isolement a du moins le bon côté de me
pousser au travail. Je travaille un peu, mais cela va mal,
comme d'ordinaire en été.</p>

<p>It was here that the incident occurred described in
<i>Lucerne</i>, a sketch published in the September number of
the <i>Contemporary</i> that same year, and one which in its
fierce castigation of the rich is a precursor of much that
he wrote thirty years later. Especially the conduct of the
wealthy English tourists roused his ire. The particular
incident the story deals with is this:</p>

<p class="i2">On 7 July 1857, in Lucerne, in front of the Schweizerhof
Hotel, where the richest people stay, an itinerant mendicant-singer
sang songs and played his guitar for half-an-hour.
About a hundred people listened to him. Three times the
singer asked them to give him something, but not one of them
did so, and many laughed at him.</p>

<p class="i2">This is not fiction, but a positive fact, which any one who
cares may verify by asking the permanent inhabitants of the
Schweizerhof, and by looking up the newspaper lists of foreign
visitors at the Schweizerhof on 7 July.</p>

<p class="i2">It is an event which the historians of our times should
inscribe in indelible letters of fire.</p>

<p>In the story, Prince Nehlúdof, indignant at such treatment
of a man who was a real artist and whose songs all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had enjoyed, brought the singer into the hotel and treated
him to a bottle of wine. He goes on to ask himself:</p>

<p class="i2">Which is more a man, and which more a barbarian: the lord
who, on seeing the singer's worn-out clothes, angrily left the
table, and for his service did not give him a millionth part of
his property, and who now sits satiated, in a well-lit, comfortable
room, calmly discussing the affairs of China and approving
the murders that are being committed there&mdash;or the little
singer who with a franc in his pocket, risking imprisonment,
has tramped over hill and dale for twenty years, harming no
one but cheering many by his songs, and whom they insulted
to-day and all but turned out, leaving him&mdash;weary, hungry and
humiliated&mdash;to make his bed somewhere on rotting straw?</p>

<p>After passing a few weeks at Lucerne, Tolstoy returned
to Russia <i>viâ</i> Stuttgart, Berlin, and Stettin, from which
port he took steamer to Petersburg, and after staying a
week there to see Nekrásof and meet his colleagues of
the <i>Contemporary</i>, he went through Moscow to Yásnaya,
where he arrived in August. In his Diary we find this
note:</p>

<p class="i2">This is how, on my journey, I planned my future occupations:
first, literary work; next, family duties; then, estate
management. But the estate I must leave as far as possible
to the steward, softening him and making improvements, and
spending only Rs. 2000 a year [then equal to about £270], and
using the rest for the serfs. Above all, my stumbling-block is
Liberal vanity. To live for oneself and do a good deed a day,
is sufficient.</p>

<p>Further on he says: 'Self-sacrifice does not lie in saying
"Take what you like from me," but in labouring and
thinking, and contriving how to give oneself.'</p>

<p>At this time he read (in translation) the <i>Iliad</i> and the
Gospels, which both impressed him greatly. 'I have
finished reading the indescribably beautiful end of the
<i>Iliad</i>,' he notes, and expresses his regret that there is no
connection between those two wonderful works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>In October he first accompanied his brother Nicholas
and his sister Mary to Moscow, and then spent a few days
in Petersburg, where he found that he had been forgotten
by a world absorbed in the great measures of public
reform then in course of preparation. Here is a sentence
from his Diary:</p>

<p class="i2">Petersburg at first mortified me and then put me right. My
reputation has fallen and hardly gives a squeak, and I felt
much hurt; but now I am tranquil. I know I have something
to say and strength to say it strongly; and the public may then
say what it will. But I must work conscientiously, exerting all
my powers; then ... let them spit upon the altar.</p>

<p>By the end of October (old style) he was back in
Moscow, established in furnished apartments in the
Pyátnitsky Street, with his sister and his brother Nicholas.
His friend Fet was also in Moscow at this time, and in his
<i>Recollections</i> makes frequent mention of the Tolstoys. He
tells us that the Countess Mary (who was an exceedingly
accomplished pianist) used to come to his house for music
in the evenings, accompanied sometimes by both her
brothers and sometimes by Nicholas alone, who would say:</p>

<p>'Lyóvotchka has again donned his evening clothes and
white necktie, and gone to a ball.'</p>

<p>Tolstoy's elegance in dress was very noticeable at this
period. We read of the grey beaver collar of his overcoat,
of a fashionable cane he carried, and of the glossy hat he
wore placed on one side, as well as of his curly, dark-brown
hair.</p>

<p>Gymnastics were fashionable in Moscow in those days,
and any one wishing to find Tolstoy between one and two
o'clock in the afternoon, could do so at the Gymnasium on
the Great Dmítrovka Street, where, dressed in gymnastic
attire, he might be seen intent on springing over the
vaulting-horse without upsetting a cone placed on its back.
He always was expert at physical exercises: a first-rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
horseman, quick at all games and sports, a swimmer, and
an excellent skater.</p>

<p>Among the visitors Fet met at Tolstoy's house we note
the name of Saltykóf, who under the pseudonym of
Stchedrín is known as one of the keenest and most powerful
of Russia's satirists, and who during the last seven years
of the reign of Nicholas I had lived in banishment in the
far-off town of Vyátka. Another guest was B. N. Tchitchérin,
philosopher and jurist, and author of works on <i>Science and
Religion</i>, <i>Property and the State</i>, and other subjects
Tolstoy dealt with three or four decades later. Katkóf,
editor of the <i>Moscow Gazette</i> and monthly <i>Russian
Messenger</i>, was another acquaintance; and in his magazine
some of Tolstoy's chief works appeared.</p>


<h3>1858</h3>

<p>In January 1858 Tolstoy's aunt, who had been a friend
of his boyhood, the Countess Alexandra A. Tolstoy, Maid
of Honour to the Grand Duchess Márya Nikoláyevna,
came to Moscow. Through this aunt
(who lived to a great age, and died only a few years ago)
Tolstoy used to receive information of what went on at
Court, and was sometimes able indirectly to exert influence
'in the highest circles.' When she returned to Petersburg
Tolstoy accompanied her as far as the town of Klin, on the
Nicholas railway, and took the opportunity to visit the
Princess Volkónsky (a cousin of his mother's), who had a
small estate in those parts. He remained some weeks with
this affectionate old lady, who told him much about his
mother and her family, and he greatly enjoyed his quiet
stay with her. At her house he wrote <i>Three Deaths</i>, which
appeared the following January in <i>The Reading Library</i>.
It is an admirably written study of the deaths of a rich
lady, a poor post-horse driver, and a tree.</p>

<p>In February he returned to Yásnaya Polyána; then
again visited Moscow, and in March spent a fortnight in
Petersburg. His love of music reasserted itself strongly
at this period; and in conjunction with V. P. Bótkin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Perfílief, Mortier (his late rival in love) and others, he
founded the Moscow Musical Society, which ultimately
resulted in the formation of the Moscow Conservatoire
of which Nicholas Rubinstein became Director.</p>

<p>One of Tolstoy's most intimate acquaintances at this
period was S. T. Aksákof, author of stories and memoirs,
lover of hunting and fishing, and father of two famous
sons, both prominent Slavophil leaders.</p>

<p>The invigorating influence of spring shows itself in a
letter Tolstoy wrote about this time to his aunt, the
Countess A. A. Tolstoy (whom he calls 'Grandma'):</p>

<p class="p2 i2"><span class="smcap">Grandma!</span>&mdash;Spring!</p>

<p class="i2">For good people it is excellent to live in the world; and even
for such men as me, it is sometimes good. In Nature, in the
air, in everything, is hope, future&mdash;an attractive future....
Sometimes one deceives oneself and thinks that happiness and
a future await not only Nature but oneself also, and then one
feels happy. I am now in such a state, and with characteristic
egotism hasten to write to you of things that interest only me.
When I review things sanely, I know very well that I am an
old, frozen little potato, and one already boiled with sauce; but
spring so acts on me that I sometimes catch myself in the full
blaze of imagining myself a plant which with others has only
now blossomed, and which will peacefully, simply and joyfully
grow in God's world. The result is that at this time of year,
such an internal clearing-out goes on in me, such a cleansing
and ordering, as only those who have experienced this feeling
can imagine. All the old&mdash;away! All worldly conventions,
all idleness, all egotism, all vices, all confused indefinite attachments,
all regrets, even repentances&mdash;away with you all!...
Make room for the wonderful little flowers whose buds are
swelling and growing with the spring!...</p>

<p>After much more he concludes:</p>

<p class="i2">Farewell, dear Grandma, do not be angry with me for this
nonsense, but answer with a word of wisdom, imbued with kindness,
Christian kindness! I have long wished to say that for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
you it is pleasanter to write French, and I understand feminine
thoughts better in French.</p>

<p>In April he was again at Yásnaya where, in spite of
repeated visits to Moscow, he spent most of the summer.
There was at this time no railway from Moscow southward
to Toúla; and the serfs' belief concerning the new telegraph
posts which stood by the side of the highroad, was
that when the wire had been completed, 'Freedom' would
be sent along it from Petersburg. Even Tatiána Alexándrovna
Érgolsky did not understand these new-fangled
things, and, when driving along the road one day, asked
Tolstoy to explain how letters were written by telegraph.
He told her as simply as he could how the telegraphic
apparatus works, and received the reply: '<i>Oui, oui, je comprends,
mon cher!</i>' How much she had really understood
was however shown half an hour later when, after keeping
her eye on the wire all that time, she inquired: 'But how
is it, <i>mon cher Léon</i>, that during a whole half-hour I have
not seen a single letter go along the telegraph?'</p>

<p>Fet and his wife used to stay a day or two at Yásnaya
when journeying to and from Moscow, and Fet's account
of Aunt Tatiána accords with Tolstoy's own affectionate
recollections of that lady. Fet says that he and his wife
'made the acquaintance of Tolstoy's charming old aunt,
Tatiána Alexándrovna Érgolsky, who received us with that
old-world affability which puts one at once at one's ease
on entering a new house. She did not devote herself to
memories of times long past, but lived fully in the present.'</p>

<p>Speaking of them all by their pet names, she mentioned
that 'Seryózhenka Tolstoy had gone to his home at Pirogóvo,
but Nikólenka would probably stay a bit longer in
Moscow with Máshenka, but Lyóvotchka's friend Dyákof
had recently visited them,' and so on.</p>

<p>Many years later, Tolstoy jotted down his memories of
the long autumn and winter evenings spent with Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Tatiána to which, he says, he owed his best thoughts and
impulses. He would sit in his arm-chair reading, thinking,
and occasionally listening to her kindly and gentle conversation
with two of the servants: Natálya Petróvna (an
old woman who lived there not because she was of much
use, but because she had nowhere else to live) and a maid
Doúnetchka.</p>

<p class="i2">The chief charm of that life lay in the absence of any
material care; in good relations with those nearest&mdash;relations no
one could spoil; and in the leisureliness and the unconsciousness
of flying time....</p>

<p class="i2">When, after living badly at a neighbour's in Toúla, with cards,
gipsies, hunting, and stupid vanity, I used to return home and
come to her, by old habit we would kiss each other's hand,
I her dear energetic hand, and she my dirty, vicious hand; and
also by old habit, we greeted one another in French, and I
would joke with Natálya Petróvna, and would sit down in the
comfortable arm-chair. She knew well all I had been doing
and regretted it, but never reproached me, retaining always the
same gentleness and love.... I was once telling her how some
one's wife had gone away with another man, and I said the
husband ought to be glad to be rid of her. And suddenly my
aunt lifted her eyebrows and said, as a thing long decided in
her mind, that that would be wrong of the husband, because it
would completely ruin the wife. After that she told me of a
drama that had occurred among the serfs. Then she re-read a
letter from my sister Máshenka, whom she loved if not more,
at least as much as she loved me, and she spoke of Másha's
husband (her own nephew) not to condemn him, but with grief
for the sorrow he inflicted on Máshenka.... The chief characteristic
of her life, which involuntarily infected me, was her
wonderful, general kindliness to every one without exception.
I try to recall a single instance of her being angry, or speaking
a sharp word, or condemning any one, and I cannot recall one
such instance in the course of thirty years. She spoke well
of our real aunt, who had bitterly hurt her by taking us away
from her.... As to her kindly treatment of the servants&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
goes without saying. She had grown up in the idea that
there are masters and servants, but she utilised her authority
only to serve them.... She never blamed me directly for my
evil life, though she suffered on my account. My brother
Sergéy, too, whom also she loved warmly, she did not reproach
even when he took a gipsy girl to live with him. The only
shade of disquietude she showed on our account was that, when
he was very late in returning home, she would say: 'What has
become of our Sergius?' Only <i>Sergius</i> instead of <i>Seryósha</i>....
She never told us in words how to live, never preached to us.
All her moral work was done internally; externally one only
saw her deeds&mdash;and not even deeds: there were no deeds; but
all her life, peaceful, sweet, submissive and loving, not troubled
or self-satisfied, but a life of quiet, unobtrusive love.... Her
affectionateness and tranquillity made her society noticeably
attractive and gave a special charm to intimacy with her. I
know of no case where she offended any one, and of no one who
did not love her. She never spoke of herself, never of religion
or of what we ought to believe, or of how she believed or
prayed. She believed everything, except that she rejected one
dogma&mdash;that of eternal torment. '<i>Dieu, qui est la bonté même,
ne peut pas vouloir nos souffrances.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>... She often called me by
my father's name (Nicholas) and this pleased me very much,
because it showed that her conceptions of me and of my father
mingled in her love of us both.</p>

<p class="i2">It was not her love for me alone that was joyous. What was
joyous was the atmosphere of love to all who were present or
absent, alive or dead, and even to animals....</p>

<p>After telling of her goodness and her affection Tolstoy
says in his Memoirs that, though he appreciated his happiness
with her, he did not at the time nearly realise its full
value; and he adds:</p>

<p class="i2">She was fond of keeping sweets: figs, gingerbreads and dates,
in various jars in her room. I cannot forget, nor remember
without a cruel pang of remorse, that I repeatedly refused her
money she wanted for such things and how she, sighing sadly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
remained silent. It is true I was in need of money, but I
cannot now remember without horror that I refused her.</p>

<p>Again in another place, after mentioning her self-devotion,
he says:</p>

<p class="i2">And it was to her, to her, that I refused the small pleasure
of having figs and chocolate (and not so much for herself as to
treat me) and of being able to give a trifle to those who begged
of her.... Dear, dear Aunty, forgive me! <i>Si jeunesse savait,
si vieillesse pouvait</i> [if youth but knew, if age but could], I mean
not in the sense of the good lost for oneself in youth, but in the
sense of the good not given and the evil done to those who are
no more.</p>

<p>Of Leo's life at Yásnaya at this time, his brother
Nicholas gave Fet the following humorous account:</p>

<p class="i2">Lyóvotchka is zealously trying to become acquainted with
peasant life and with farming, of both of which, like the rest of
us, he has till now had but a superficial knowledge. But I am
not sure what sort of acquaintance will result from his efforts:
Lyóvotchka wants to get hold of everything at once, without
omitting anything&mdash;even his gymnastics. So he has rigged
up a bar under his study window. And of course, apart from
prejudice, with which he wages such fierce war, he is right:
gymnastics do not interfere with farming; but the steward sees
things differently and says, 'One comes to the master for orders,
and he hangs head downward in a red jacket, holding on by
one knee to a perch, and swings himself. His hair hangs down
and blows about, the blood comes to his face, and one does not
know whether to listen to his orders or to be astonished at him!'</p>

<p class="i2">Lyóvotchka is delighted with the way the serf Ufán sticks
out his arms when ploughing; and so Ufán has become for him
an emblem of village strength, like the legendary Michael; and
he himself, sticking his elbows out wide, takes to the plough
and 'Ufanizes.'</p>

<p>In May 1858 Tolstoy wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dearest little Uncle</span> [as we might say, Dear old Boy]!&mdash;I
write two words merely to say that I embrace you with all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
might, have received your letter, kiss the hand of Márya Petróvna
[Fet's wife] and make obeisance to you all. Aunty thanks
you very much for your message and bows to you, so also does
my sister. What a wonderful spring it has been and is! I, in
solitude, have tasted it admirably. Brother Nicholas must be
at Nikólsk. Catch him and do not let him go. I want to come
to see you this month. Tourgénef has gone to Winzig till
August to cure his bladder.</p>

<p class="i2">Devil take him. I am tired of loving him. He deserts us,
and won't cure his bladder.</p>

<p class="i2">Now good-bye, dear friend. If you have no poem ready
for me by the time I come, I shall proceed to squeeze one
out of you.&mdash;Your</p>

<p class="i2 rightm"><span class="smcap">Count L. Tolstoy</span>.</p>

<p>Another letter to Fet runs:</p>

<p class="i2">Ay, old fellow, ahoy! First, you give no sign, though it is
spring and you know we are all thinking of you, and that I,
like Prometheus, am bound to a rock, yet thirst for sight or
sound of you. You should either come, or at least send us a
proper invitation. Secondly, you have retained my brother,
and a very good brother, surnamed 'Firdusi' [an allusion to
Nicholas's Oriental wisdom]. The chief culprit in this matter,
I suspect, is Márya Petróvna, to whom I humbly bow, requesting
her to return us our own brother. Jesting apart, he bids
me let you know that he will be here next week. Drouzhínin
will also come, so mind you come too, old fellow.</p>

<p>The first record of any participation by Tolstoy in
political affairs relates to the preparations for the Emancipation
of the serfs. Immediately after the conclusion of
the Crimean war Alexander II, addressing the Marshals
of the Nobility, in Moscow, had said: 'The existing
manner of possessing serfs cannot remain unchanged. It
is better to abolish serfdom from above than to await the
time when it will begin to abolish itself from below. I
request you, gentlemen, to consider how this can be done,
and to submit my words to the Nobility for their consideration.'
Some time passed without any definite response
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to this appeal, and meanwhile the Polish nobility
of the Lithuanian Provinces, dissatisfied with certain regulations
enacted in the previous reign, incautiously asked to
have them revised. The Government grasped the opportunity,
and treating this as the expression of a wish for
Emancipation, replied that 'the abolition of serfdom must
be effected not suddenly, but gradually,' and authorised
the Nobility to form Committees for the preparation of
definite projects to that end. Four days later the Minister
of the Interior, acting on secret orders from the Emperor,
sent a circular to all the Governors and Marshals of the
Nobility in Russia proper, stating that the Lithuanian
nobles 'had recognised the necessity of liberating the
peasants,' and that 'this noble intention' had afforded
peculiar satisfaction to His Majesty, and explaining the
principles to be observed in case the nobles of other
Provinces should express a similar desire. A few weeks
later the Emperor publicly expressed a hope that, with the
co-operation of his nobles, the work of Emancipation
would be successfully accomplished. It therefore became
quite evident that, whether the nobles liked it or not,
Emancipation was at hand; since the Emperor had, at
last, definitely ranged himself on the side of the Emancipationists.
By accepting the invitation to co-operate in the
preparation of the scheme, there appeared to be a chance
that the nobles might so shape the measure that their
interests would not suffer; and consequently, during 1858,
a Committee was chosen in almost every Province of Central
Russia. Among the rest a Meeting of the Nobility of the
Government of Toúla was fixed for the first of September, to
elect Deputies to the Committee for the Improvement of the
Condition of the Peasants. Tolstoy attended this meeting,
and together with one hundred and four fellow-nobles signed
a document stating that 'with the object of improving the
condition of the peasants, preserving the property of the
landowners, and securing the safety of both the one and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the other, we consider it necessary that the peasants should
be liberated not otherwise than with an allotment of a
certain amount of land in hereditary possession, and that
the landowners should receive for the land they give up,
full, equitable, pecuniary recompense by means of such
financial measures as will not entail any obligatory relations
between peasants and proprietors,&mdash;relations which
the Nobility consider it necessary to terminate.'</p>

<p>There is no indication that Tolstoy took any prominent
part in this meeting; and the resolution just quoted, while
approving of Emancipation, seems to attach at least equal
importance to securing full compensation for the landowners.
Explain it how one may, the fact remains that
while the <i>Contemporary</i>, and all that was progressive in
Russian literature, was preoccupied with the effort to help
to shape the reforms so that they might really attain the
ends aimed at, Tolstoy almost retired from the scene, and
hardly appeared aware of the movement going on around
him. The battle for freedom was fought in the press by
Tchernyshévsky, Kosheléf, and N. Samárin, by Herzen, and
by many others, including Nekrásof and Saltykóf; and
Tolstoy's indifference helps to explain the fact, already
alluded to, that during these years the critics ignored
him, though his artistic power continued to increase. His
friend Fet also took no part in the Emancipation movement;
being in fact rather opposed to it.</p>

<p>On 24th October 1858 Tolstoy writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">To write stories is stupid and shameful. To write verses&mdash;well,
write them; but to love a good man is very pleasant.
Yet perhaps, against my will and intention, not I, but an
unripe story inside me, compels me to love you. It sometimes
seems like that. Do what one will amid the manure and the
mange, one somehow begins to compose. Thank heaven, I
have not yet allowed myself to write, and will not do so....
Thank you exceedingly for your trouble about a veterinary. I
have found one in Toúla and have begun the cure, but I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
not know what will come of it.&mdash;And, may the devil take them
all,&mdash;Drouzhínin is appealing to me as a matter of friendship
to write a story. I really want to. I will spin such a yarn
that there will be no head or tail to it.... But joking apart,
how is your Hafiz getting on? [Fet was translating some
poems by Hafiz.] Turn it which way you will, the height of
wisdom and fortitude for me is to enjoy the poetry of others,
and not to let my own in ugly garb loose among men, but to
consume it myself with my daily bread. But at times one
suddenly wishes to be a great man, and it is so annoying that
this has not yet come about! One even hurries to get up
quicker or to finish dinner in order to begin.... Send me a
poem, the healthiest of those you have translated from Hafiz,
<i>me faire venir l'eau à la bouche</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and I will send you a sample of
wheat. Hunting has bored me to death. The weather is
excellent, but I do not hunt alone.</p>

<p>In company, Tolstoy was however a keen sportsman,
and in December 1858 nearly lost his life while out
bear-shooting. He has told the story, with some embellishments,
in one of the tales for children contained
in the volume. <i>Twenty-three Tales</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The real facts were
these:</p>

<p>Tolstoy and his brother Nicholas had made the acquaintance
of S. S. Gromeka, a well-known publicist who shared
their fondness for hunting&mdash;a sport very different in Russia
from what it is in England, as readers of Tolstoy's descriptions
well know.</p>

<p>Gromeka having heard that a she-bear with two young
ones had her lair in the forest near the railway at Volotchók,
half-way between Petersburg and Moscow, arranged
matters with the peasants of that locality, and invited the
Tolstoys and other guests to a hunt. The invitation was
accepted, and on 21st December Leo Tolstoy shot a bear.
On 22nd the members of the party, each armed with two
guns, were placed at the ends of cuttings running through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the forest in which the big she-bear had been surrounded.
These paths or cuttings divided the wood like the lines
of a chess-board. Peasants employed as beaters were
stationed to prevent the animal escaping except by
approaching one or other of the sportsmen. Ostáshkof, a
famous professional huntsman, supervised the proceedings.
The guests were advised to stamp down the snow around
them, so as to give themselves room to move freely; but
Tolstoy (with his usual objection to routine methods)
argued that as they were out to shoot the bear and not
to box with her, it was useless to tread down the snow.
He therefore stood with his two-barrelled gun in his hand,
surrounded by snow almost up to his waist.</p>

<p>Tile bear, roused by the shouts of Ostáshkof, rushed
down a cutting directly towards one of the other sportsmen;
but, perceiving him, she suddenly swerved from her
course and took a cross path which brought her out on to
the cutting leading straight to Tolstoy. He, not expecting
her visit, did not fire until the beast was within
six yards, and his first shot missed. The bear was only
two yards from him when his second shot hit her in the
mouth. It failed to stop her rush, and she knocked
Tolstoy over on to his back in the snow. Carried past
him at first by her own impetus, the bear soon returned;
and the next thing Tolstoy knew was that he was
being weighed down by something heavy and warm, and
he then felt that his face was being drawn into the
beast's mouth. He could only offer a passive resistance,
by drawing down his head as much as possible between
his shoulders and trying to present his cap instead of his
face to the bear's teeth. This state of things lasted only
a few seconds, yet long enough for the bear, after one
or two misses, to get her teeth into the flesh above
and below his left eye. At this moment Ostáshkof,
armed with a small switch, came running up, shouting:
'Where are you getting to? Where are you getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to?' At which the beast promptly took fright, and
rushed off. Next day she was followed up and killed.
Owing to the amount of blood and torn flesh, Tolstoy's
wound at first appeared serious; but when it had been
washed with snow, and he had been taken to the nearest
town and had had it sewn up, it turned out to be superficial.
He long retained a very noticeable scar however as
a memento of the encounter; and the bear's skin may still
be seen at Yásnaya.</p>

<p><i>Family Happiness</i>, written partly in 1858, was published
early in 1859. It grew out of the unsuccessful love affair
mentioned in the last chapter, and is Tolstoy's imaginative
description of what might have been.</p>


<h3>1859</h3>

<p>The first months of 1859 he spent in Moscow, and here
on the occasion of joining the Moscow Society of Lovers
of Russian Literature, on 4th February, he for the
first time made a public speech: a task for which,
he once told me, he had no aptitude, and which he much
disliked. He wrote it out, and it was to have appeared in
the Proceedings of the Society, but for some reason never
got printed. Its subject was 'The Supremacy of the
Artistic Element in Literature,' and in it he maintained
a position almost the opposite of the one he advocated so
ardently and with such full conviction in <i>What is Art?</i>
forty years later.</p>

<p>He was answered by the Slavophil A. S. Homyakóf,
who presided at the meeting, and who in the course of
his remarks said:</p>

<p class="i2">Allow me to remark that the justice of the opinion you have
so skilfully stated is far from destroying the legitimacy of the
temporary and exceptional side of literature. That which is
always right, that which is always beautiful, that which is as
unalterable as the most fundamental laws of the soul, undoubtedly
holds, and should hold, the first place in the thoughts,
the impulses, and therefore in the speech of man. It, and it
alone, will be handed on by generation to generation and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
nation to nation as a precious inheritance. But on the other
hand, in the nature of man and of society there is continual
need for self-indictment. There are moments, moments important
in history, when that self-indictment acquires a special
and indefeasible right, and manifests itself in literature with
great definiteness and keenness....</p>

<p class="i2">The rights of literature, the servant of eternal beauty, do not
destroy the rights of the literature of indictment, which always
accompanies social deficiencies and sometimes appears as the
healer of social evils....</p>

<p class="i2">Of course, Art is perfectly free: it finds its justification and
its aim in itself. But the freedom of Art in the abstract, has
nothing to do with the inner life of the artist. An artist is
not a theory&mdash;a sphere of thought and mental activity&mdash;but a
man, and always a man of his own times, usually its best
representative, completely imbued with its spirit and its defined
or nascent aspirations. By the very impressionability of his
nature, without which he could not be an artist, he, even more
than others, receives all the painful as well as joyous sensations
of the society to which he is born....</p>

<p class="i2">So the writer, a servant of pure art, sometimes becomes an
accuser even unconsciously, and despite his own will. I allow
myself, Count, to cite you as an example. You consciously
follow a definite road faithfully and undeviatingly; but are you
really completely alien to the literature of indictment? Were
it but in the picture of a consumptive post-boy, dying on top
of a stove amid a crowd of comrades apparently indifferent to
his sufferings [this refers to <i>Three Deaths</i>] have you not indicated
some social disease, some evil? When describing that
death, is it possible that you did not suffer from the horny
indifference of good but unawakened human souls? Yes, you
too have been and will be an involuntary indicter!</p>

<p>This question of the true position of literary art and
its relation to the rest of life, was one which occupied
Tolstoy for many years, and on which before the century
closed he expressed himself in a book which must be
reckoned with by all who may hereafter deal with the subject.
The attitude he maintained at the time he entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the Society of Lovers of Russian Literature, was in striking
contrast with that of the Slavophils, such as Homyakóf,
and of the great majority of the leading Russian writers
of that day, who were fired with the hope of Emancipation,
just as in America at the same time, Lowell, Emerson,
Whittier, Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Longfellow, Channing,
Lloyd Garrison, and others, were stirred by the Anti-Slavery
movement.</p>

<p>In April Tolstoy went to Petersburg and spent ten
days very pleasantly with his aunt the Countess A. A.
Tolstoy. By the end of the month he was back at Yásnaya.
In July, Tourgénef, from France, wrote Fet a long letter in
blank verse, a few lines of which indicate the relation between
Leo Tolstoy and himself at this time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">'Kiss Nicholas Tolstoy on my behalf</div>
<div class="line">And to his brother Leo make my bow,</div>
<div class="line">&mdash;As to his sister also.</div>
<div class="line">He rightly says in his postscriptum:</div>
<div class="line">"There is no cause" for me to write to him,</div>
<div class="line">Indeed, I know he bears me little love</div>
<div class="line">And I love him as little. Too differently</div>
<div class="line">Are mixed those elements of which we're formed.'</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3>1859-1860</h3>

<p>During this winter Tolstoy devoted much time to an
attempt to organise schools on and near his estate. The
education of its peasant children was one of the
things Russia most needed, and most terribly
neglected. Tolstoy recognised this, and set himself strenuously
and eagerly to show how the great need could be met.
The work he did at this time was, however, only preliminary
to what he undertook after his next visit to Western
Europe, and he was far from being mentally at peace. At
the commencement of the New Year he noted in his Diary:
'The burden of the estate, the burden of bachelor life, and
all sorts of doubts and pessimistic feelings agitate my
mind.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
One mention of the serfs (who were now nearing freedom)
occurs in a letter Tolstoy wrote to Fet on 23rd
February 1860, in reply to a note in which the latter had
expressed a wish to buy an estate, settle down in the
country, and devote himself to farming. Tolstoy replies that
there is an estate for sale adjoining his own, containing:</p>

<p class="i2">Four hundred desyatíns of good land with, unfortunately,
seventy souls of bad serfs. But that does not matter; they
will gladly pay quit-rent [in lieu of personal service] as mine
do, at the rate of Rs. 30 a <i>tyaglo</i> [man and wife with an allotment
of land] or Rs. 660 for the twenty-two <i>tyaglos</i>, and you
will get not less than that, if not more, at the Emancipation,
and will have sufficient unexhausted land and meadow left
to yield about Rs. 2000 a year, or over Rs. 2600 in all. The
price asked for the estate is Rs. 24,000, besides a mortgage
of about Rs. 5000.... At any rate it would be a good bargain
to buy it for Rs. 20,000.... The seller is an old man who is
ruined, and wants to sell it quickly in order to get rid of his
son-in-law. He has twice sent to offer it me. The above
calculation shows what the estate should yield in a couple of
years' time if about Rs. 5000 be spent on improving it; but
even in its present condition one can answer for a return of
Rs. 1500, which is more than 7 per cent. on the cost.</p>

<p>In Russia to buy serfs was not then considered more discreditable
than it is in England to-day to buy shares in a
china or match factory; and in the same letter Tolstoy
goes on to discuss literature:</p>

<p class="i2">I have read Tourgénef's <i>On the Eve</i>. This is my opinion:
to write novels is undesirable, especially for people who are
depressed and do not well know what they want from life.
However, <i>On the Eve</i> is much better than <i>A Nest of Gentlefolk</i>,
and there are in it excellent negative characters: the artist and
the father. The rest are not types; even their conception,
their position, is not typical, or they are quite insignificant.
That however is always Tourgénef's mistake. The girl is hopelessly
bad: 'Ah, how I love thee ... her eyelashes were long.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
In general it always surprises me that Tourgénef, with his
mental powers and poetic sensibility, should even in his
methods not be able to refrain from banality. This banality
shows itself most of all in his negative methods, which recall
Gógol. There is no humanity or sympathy for the characters,
but the author exhibits monsters whom he scolds and does not
pity. This jars painfully with the tone and intention of
Liberalism in everything else. It was all very well in the days
of Tsar Goroh [a character in a fairy story] or of Gógol (though
if one does not pity even the most insignificant of one's characters,
one should scold them so that the heavens grow hot, or
laugh at them so that one's sides split, and not as our splenetic
and dyspeptic Tourgénef does). On the whole, however, there
is now no one else who could write such a novel, though it will
not meet with success.</p>

<p class="i2">Ostróvsky's <i>The Storm</i> is, in my opinion, a wretched work, but
will be successful. Not Ostróvsky and Tourgénef are to blame,
but the times.... Something else is now needed: not that
we should learn and criticise, but that we should teach Jack
and Jill at least a little of what we know.</p>

<p>This letter to Fet, who was in Moscow, ends with requests
to procure some books, including a veterinary handbook,
a veterinary instrument, and a lancet for use on
human beings; to see about procuring six ploughs of a
special make, and to find out the price of clover and
timothy-grass, of which Tolstoy had some to sell.</p>


<h3>1860</h3>

<p>At this time Tolstoy worked at his story <i>The Cossacks</i>,
the plan of which he had sketched out in 1852,
but which he did not complete till 1862.</p>

<p>One comes across notes in his Diary which indicate his
state of mind at this period with regard to religion. After
reading a book on Materialism he notes:</p>

<p class="i2">I thought of prayer. To what can one pray? What is God,
imagined so clearly that one can ask him to communicate with
us? If I imagine such an one, he loses all grandeur for me.
A God whom one can beseech and whom one can serve&mdash;is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
expression of mental weakness. He is God, because I cannot
grasp his being. Indeed, he is not a Being, but a Law and
a Force.</p>

<p>He was a great puzzle to his friends and acquaintances&mdash;always
ready to take his own line strenuously, yet sometimes
far from sure what that line was. Tourgénef wrote
to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">Leo Tolstoy continues his eccentricities. Evidently it was so
decreed at his birth. When will he turn his last somersault and
stand on his feet?</p>

<p>The fact that Tolstoy, like his friend Fet, was neglecting
literature did not fail to call forth many remonstrances,
one of the most urgent of which came to him from Drouzhínin,
who wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">Every writer has his moments of doubt and self-dissatisfaction,
and however strong and legitimate this feeling may be,
no one on that account has yet ceased his connection with
literature; every one goes on writing to the end. But all
tendencies, good or bad, cling to you with peculiar obstinacy;
so that you, more than others, need to think of this and to consider
the whole matter amicably.</p>

<p class="i2">First of all, remember that after poetry and mental labour
all other work seems worthless. <i>Qui a bu, boira</i>; and at the
age of thirty to tear oneself away from authorship means losing
half the interest of life. But that is only half the matter;
there is something still more important.</p>

<p class="i2">On all of us lies a responsibility rooted in the immense
importance of literature to Russian society. An Englishman or
an American may laugh at the fact that in Russia not merely
men of thirty, but grey-haired owners of 2000 serfs sweat
over stories of a hundred pages, which appear in the magazines,
are devoured by everybody, and arouse discussion in society
for a whole day. However much artistic quality may have to
do with this result, you cannot explain it merely by Art. What
in other lands is a matter of idle talk and careless dilettantism,
with us is quite another affair. Among us things have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
such shape that a story&mdash;the most frivolous and insignificant
form of literature&mdash;becomes one of two things: either it is
rubbish, or else it is the voice of a leader sounding throughout
the Empire. For instance, we all know Tourgénef's weakness,
but a whole ocean divides the most insignificant of his stories
from the very best of Mrs. Eugene Tour's, with her half-talent.
By some strange instinct the Russian public has chosen from
among the crowd of writers four or five bell-men whom it
values as leaders, refusing to listen to any qualifications or
deductions. You&mdash;partly by talent, partly by the practical
qualities of your soul, and partly owing simply to a concurrence
of fortunate circumstances&mdash;have stepped into this favourable
relation with the public. On that account you must not go
away and hide, but must work, even to the exhaustion of your
strength and powers. That is one side of the matter; but here
is another. You are a member of a literary circle that is
honourable (as far as may be), independent, and influential;
and which for ten years, amid persecutions and misfortunes,
and notwithstanding its members' vices, has firmly upheld the
banner of all that is Liberal and enlightened, and has borne all
this weight of abuse without committing one mean action. In
spite of the world's coldness and ignorance and its contempt
for literature, this circle is rewarded with honour and moral
influence. Of course, there are in it insignificant and even
stupid homunculi; but even they play a part in the general
union, and have not been useless. In that circle you again,
though you arrived but recently, have a place and a voice such
as Ostróvsky for instance does not possess, though he has
immense talent and his moral tendency is as worthy as
your own. Why this has happened it would take too
long to analyse, nor is it to the point. If you tear yourself
off from the circle of writers and become inactive, you
will be dull, and will deprive yourself of an important rôle
in society....</p>

<p>At this time the state of health of his brother Nicholas&mdash;who
(like Demetrius) had consumptive tendencies&mdash;began
to disturb Leo Tolstoy. It was arranged that Nicholas
should go to Germany for a cure. The following letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
written by Leo Tolstoy to Fet, after Nicholas had started,
refers to this and other matters:</p>

<p class="i2">... You are a writer and remain a writer, and God speed
you. But that, besides this, you wish to find a spot where you
can dig like an ant, is an idea which has come to you and which
you must carry out, and carry out better than I have done.
You must do it because you are both a good man and one who
looks at life healthily.... However, it is not for me now to
deal out to you approval or disapproval with an air of authority.
I am greatly at sixes and sevens with myself. Farming on the
scale on which it is carried out on my estate, crushes me. To
'Ufanize'<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> is a thing I only see afar off. Family affairs,
Nicholas's illness (of which we have as yet no news from
abroad) and my sister's departure (she leaves me in three days'
time) also crush and occupy me. Bachelor life, <i>i.e.</i> not having
a wife, and the thought that it is getting too late, torments me
from a third side. In general, everything is now out of tune
with me. On account of my sister's helplessness and my wish
to see Nicholas, I shall at any rate procure a foreign passport
to-morrow, and perhaps I shall accompany my sister abroad;
especially if we do not receive news, or receive bad news, from
Nicholas. How much I would give to see you before leaving,
how much I want to tell you and to hear from you; but it is
now hardly possible. Yet if this letter reaches you quickly,
remember that we leave Yásnaya on Thursday or more probably
on Friday.</p>

<p class="i2">Now as to farming: The price they ask of you is not exorbitant,
and if the place pleases you, you should buy it.
Only why do you want so much land? I have learned by three
years' experience that with all imaginable diligence it is impossible
to grow cereals profitably or pleasantly on more than 60 or
70 desyatíns [160 to 190 acres] that is, on about 15 desyatíns in
each of four fields. Only in that way can one escape trembling
for every omission (for then one ploughs not twice but three or
four times) and for every hour a peasant misses, and for every
extra rouble-a-month one pays him; for one can bring 15 desy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>atíns
to the point of yielding 30 to 40 per cent. on the
fixed and working capital; but with 80 or 100 desyatíns under
plough one cannot do so. Please do not let this advice slip
past your ears; it is not idle talk, but a result of experience I
have had to pay for. Any one who tells you differently is either
lying or ignorant. More than that, even with 15 desyatíns an
all-absorbing industry is necessary. But then one can gain
a reward&mdash;one of the pleasantest life gives; whereas with 90
desyatíns one has to labour like a post-horse, with no possibility
of success. I cannot find sufficient words to scold myself for
not having written to you sooner&mdash;in which case you would
surely have come to see us. Now farewell.</p>

<p>Things meanwhile were not going very well with
Nicholas, who wrote from Soden in Hesse-Nassau:</p>

<p class="i2">In Soden we joined Tourgénef, who is alive and well&mdash;so
well that he himself confesses that he is 'quite' well. He has
found some German girl and goes into ecstasies about her. We
(this relates to our dearest Tourgénef) play chess together, but
somehow it does not go as it should: he is thinking of his
German girl, and I of my cure.... I shall probably stay in
Soden for at least six weeks. I do not describe my journey
because I was ill all the time.</p>

<p>Eventually Leo Tolstoy made up his mind to accompany
his sister and her children abroad, and on 3rd July (old
style) they took steamer from Petersburg for Stettin <i>en
route</i> for Berlin. Besides anxiety on his brother's account,
Tolstoy had another reason for going abroad: he wished
to study the European systems of education, in order to
know what had been accomplished in the line to which he
now intended to devote himself.</p>

<p>On reaching Berlin he suffered from toothache for four
days, and decided to remain there while his sister proceeded
to join Nicholas at Soden. He consulted a doctor,
as he was suffering also from headache and hemorrhoidal
attacks, and he was ordered to take a cure at Kissingen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
He only stayed a few days in Berlin after getting rid of his
toothache, and left on 14th July (old style), having however
found time to attend lectures on History by Droysen,
and on Physics and Physiology by Du Bois-Reymond, and
having also visited some evening classes for artisans at the
<i>Handwerksverein</i>, where he was greatly interested in the
popular lectures, and particularly in the system of 'question-boxes.'
The method of arousing the interest of the
audience by allowing them to propound questions for the
lecturer to reply to, was new to him, and he was struck by
the life it brought into the classes, and by the freedom of
mental contact between scholars and teacher. He noticed
the same thing when he was in London a few months later,
for he told me that nothing he saw there interested him
more than a lecture he attended in South Kensington, at
which questions were put by working men, and answered
by a speaker who was master of his subject and knew how
to popularise it.</p>

<p>In Berlin he visited the Moabit Prison, in which solitary
confinement was practised. Tolstoy strongly disapproved
of this mechanical attempt to achieve moral reformation.
From Berlin he went to Leipzig, where he spent a day
inspecting schools; but he derived little satisfaction from
the Saxon schools he visited, as is indicated by a remark
he jotted down in his Diary, 'Have been in school&mdash;terrible.
Prayers for the King, blows, everything by rote, frightened,
paralysed children....' He then proceeded to Dresden,
where he called on the novelist Auerbach, whose story, <i>Ein
Neues Leben</i> (<i>A New Life</i>), had much influenced him. The
chief character in that story is Count Fulkenberg, who after
being an officer in the army, gets into trouble, escapes
from prison, buys the passport of a school-master, Eugene
Baumann, and under that name devotes himself to the
task of educating peasant children. When Auerbach
entered the room in which his visitor was waiting, the latter
introduced himself with the words: 'I am Eugene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Baumann,' in such solemn tones and with so morose an
appearance, that the German writer was taken aback and
feared that he was about to be threatened with an action
for libel. Tolstoy however hastened to add: '&mdash;not in
name, but in character&mdash;' and went on to explain how
good an effect Auerbach's <i>Schwarzwälder Dorfgeschichten</i>
(<i>Village Tales of the Black Forest</i>) had had on him.</p>

<p>After three days in Dresden, he went on to Kissingen,
which was in those days about five hours' journey from
Soden, where Nicholas was staying. Still intent on his
educational inquiries, he read <i>en route</i> a history of
pedagogics.</p>

<p>From Kissingen he wrote his Aunt Tatiána that he
thought the cure was doing him good, and added:</p>

<p class="i2">Tell the steward to write me most minutely about the
farming, the harvest, the horses and their illness. Tell the
schoolmaster to write about the school: how many pupils come,
and whether they learn well. I shall certainly return in
autumn and intend to occupy myself more than ever with the
school, so I do not wish its reputation to be lost while I am
away, and I want as many pupils as possible from different
parts.</p>

<p>While in Kissingen he read Bacon and Luther and
Riehl, and made the acquaintance of Julius Froebel, author
of <i>The System of Social Politics</i> and nephew of Froebel,
the founder of the Kindergarten system. Julius Froebel
was himself much interested in educational matters, and
was a particularly suitable person to explain his uncle's
ideas to Tolstoy.</p>

<p>The latter astonished his new acquaintance, with whom
he used to go for walks, by the uncompromising rigidity
of his views, which showed a considerable tinge of Slavophilism.
Progress in Russia, declared Tolstoy, must be
based on popular education, which would give better
results in Russia than in Germany, because the Russian
people were still unperverted, whereas the Germans were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
like children who had for years been subjected to a bad
education. Popular education should not be compulsory.
If it is a blessing, the demand for it should come naturally,
as the demand for food comes from hunger.</p>

<p>Tolstoy visited the country round Kissingen, and travelling
northward through a part of Germany rich both in
scenery and in historic interest, reached Eisenach and
visited the Wartburg, where Luther was confined after the
Diet of Worms. The personality of the great Protestant
reformer interested Tolstoy greatly, and after seeing the
room in which Luther commenced his translation of the
Bible, he noted in his Diary: 'Luther was great'!
Twenty years later Tolstoy himself attempted to free the
minds of men from the yoke of an established Church, and
he too shaped his chief weapon against the Church by
translating, not, it is true, like Luther, the whole Bible,
but the Gospels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nicholas Tolstoy's health had been growing
worse rather than better. Sergius, having been unlucky
at roulette, decided to return to Russia, and visiting
Leo at Kissingen <i>en route</i>, told him of his fears for
Nicholas. On 9th August Sergius left Kissingen and
Nicholas himself arrived there to visit Leo, but soon
returned to Soden. Leo then spent a fortnight in the
Harz Mountain district, enjoying nature and reading a
great deal. On 26th August he rejoined Nicholas, his
sister and her children, at Soden. The doctors had decided
that Nicholas must winter in a warmer climate, and the
place decided on was Hyères near Toulon, on the shores of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The first stage of the journey undertaken by the family
party was to Frankfurt-on-Main, where their aunt, the
Countess A. A. Tolstoy, was staying. She tells the
following story of Leo's visit to her on this occasion:</p>

<p class="i2">One day Prince Alexander of Hesse and his wife were calling
on me, when suddenly the door of the drawing-room opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and Leo appeared in the strangest garb, suggestive of a picture
of a Spanish bandit. I gasped with astonishment. Leo
apparently was not pleased with my visitors, and soon took his
departure.</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>'Qui est donc ce singulier personnage?' inquired my
visitors in astonishment.</p>

<p class="i2">'Mais c'est Léon Tolstoy.'</p>

<p class="i2">'Ah, mon Dieu, pourquoi ne l'avez vous pas nommé? Après
avoir lu ses admirables écrits, nous mourions d'envie de le voir,'
said they, reproachfully.</p>

<p>From Frankfurt the party proceeded to Hyères, where
Nicholas, growing rapidly worse and worse, died on 20th
September (new style).</p>

<p>Few men have been so admired and loved as he was by all
who knew him. The only thing recorded against him is the
fact that when serving in the Caucasus he, like many of his
fellow-officers, gave way to some extent to intemperance;
but after returning home he recovered his self-control. I
have already told of his influence over Leo in the early
days of the Ant-Brotherhood, and of the green stick,
buried where Tolstoy himself wishes his body to lie. Such
influence he retained all through life, and men and women
of most different temperaments make equally enthusiastic
mention of his charm and goodness. That Leo's judgment
of what is good and bad has remained strongly influenced
by his love for and memory of Nicholas, is plain enough to
all who have the facts before them and read his works
attentively.</p>

<p>Tourgénef once said:</p>

<p class="i2">The humility which Leo Tolstoy developed theoretically, his
brother actually practised in life. He always lived in the most
impossible lodgings, almost hovels, somewhere in the out-of-the-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
quarters of Moscow, and he willingly shared all he had
with the poorest outcast. He was a delightful companion and
narrator, but writing was to him almost a physical impossibility,
the actual process of writing being as difficult for him as for a
labourer whose stiff hands will not hold a pen.</p>

<p>Nicholas did, however, as a matter of fact, contribute
some <i>Memoirs of a Sportsman</i> to the <i>Contemporary</i>.</p>

<p>Never was any one's death more sincerely regretted.
This is the letter Leo wrote to Aunt Tatiána, the night the
event occurred.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Chère Tante!</span>&mdash;The black seal will have told you all. What
I have been expecting from hour to hour for two weeks occurred
at nine o'clock this evening. Only since yesterday did he let me
help him undress, and to-day for the first time he definitely took
to his bed and asked for a nurse. He was conscious all the time,
and a quarter-of-an-hour before he died he drank some milk and
told me he was comfortable. Even to-day he still joked and
showed interest in my educational projects. Only a few
minutes before he died he whispered several times: 'My God,
my God!' It seems to me that he felt his position, but
deceived himself and us. Máshenka, only to-day, some four
hours before, had gone three miles out of Hyères to where she
is living. She did not at all expect it to come so soon. I have
just closed his eyes. I shall now soon be back with you and
will tell you all personally. I do not intend to transport the
body. The funeral will be arranged by the Princess Golítsin,
who has taken it all on herself.</p>

<p class="i2">Farewell, <i>chère tante</i>. I cannot console you. It is God's
will&mdash;that is all. I am not writing to Seryózha now. He is
probably away hunting, you know where. So let him know, or
send him this letter.</p>

<p>On the day after the funeral he wrote to Sergius:</p>

<p class="i2">I think you have had news of the death of Nicholas. I am
sorry for you that you were not here. Hard as it is, I am glad
it all took place in my presence, and that it acted on me in the
right way&mdash;not like Mítenka's [his third brother, Demetrius]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
death, of which I heard when I was not thinking at all about
him. However, this is quite different. With Mítenka only
memories of childhood and family feeling were bound up; but
this was a real man both to you and to me, whom we loved and
<i>respected</i> positively more than any one else on earth. You know
the selfish feeling which came latterly, that the sooner it was
over the better; it is dreadful now to write it and to remember
that one thought it. Till the last day, with his extraordinary
strength of character and power of concentration, he did everything
to avoid becoming a burden to me. On the day of his
death he dressed and washed himself, and in the morning I
found him dressed on his bed. Only about nine hours before
he died did he give way to his illness and ask to be undressed.
It first happened in the closet. I went downstairs, and heard
his door open. I returned and did not find him. At first I
feared to go to him&mdash;he used not to like it; but this time he
himself said, 'Help me!'</p>

<p class="i2">And he submitted and became different that day, mild and
gentle. He did not groan, did not blame any one, praised
everybody, and said to me: 'Thank you, <i>my friend</i>.' You
understand what that meant between us. I told him I had
heard how he coughed in the morning, but did not come to
him from <i>fausse honte</i> [false shame]. 'Needlessly,' said he&mdash;'it
would have consoled me.' Suffering? He suffered; but it
was not until a couple of days before his death that he once said:
'How terrible these nights without sleep are! Towards morning
the cough chokes one, unendingly! And it hurts&mdash;God knows
how! A couple more such nights&mdash;it's terrible!' Not once
did he say plainly that he felt the approach of death. But he
only did not <i>say</i> it. On the day of his death he ordered a
dressing-gown, and yet when I remarked that if he did not
get better, Máshenka and I would not go to Switzerland, he
replied: 'Do you really think I shall be better?' in such a
tone that it was evident what he felt but for my sake did not
say, and what I for his sake did not show; all the same, from
the morning I knew what was coming, and was with him all
the time. He died quite without suffering&mdash;externally, at all
events. He breathed more and more slowly&mdash;and it was all
over. The next day I went to him and feared to uncover his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
face. I thought it would show yet more suffering and be more
terrible than during his illness; but you cannot imagine what
a beautiful face it was, with his best, merry, calm expression.</p>

<p class="i2">Yesterday he was buried here. At one time I thought of
transporting him, and of telegraphing for you; but I reconsidered
it. It is no use chafing the wound. I am sorry for you
that the news will have reached you out hunting, amid distractions,
and will not grip you as it does us. It is good for one.
I now feel what I have often been told, that when one loses
some one who was what he was to us, it becomes much easier to
think of one's own death.</p>

<p>On 13th October 1860 he notes in his Diary:</p>

<p class="i2">It is nearly a month since Nicholas died. That event has
torn me terribly from life. Again the question: Why?
Already the departure draws near. Whither? Nowhere. I
try to write, I force myself, but do not get on, because I
cannot attach enough importance to the work to supply the
necessary strength and patience. At the very time of the
funeral the thought occurred to me to write a Materialist
Gospel, a Life of Christ as a Materialist.</p>

<p>One sees how bit by bit the seeds of the work Tolstoy
was to do in later years planted themselves in his mind.
In early childhood came the enthusiasm for the Ant-Brotherhood
and the influence of his brother, of Aunt
Tatiána, and of the pilgrims; then an acquaintance with
the writings of Voltaire and other sceptics, undermining
belief in the miraculous; then, in Sevastopol, the idea of
'founding a new religion: Christianity purged of dogmas
and mysticism'; then a study of Luther's Reformation,
and now the idea of a rationalist Life of Christ.</p>

<div class="caption">
Tolstoy in 1860, the year his brother
Nicholas died.
</div></div>

<p>On 17th October Tolstoy writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I think you already know what has happened. On 20
September he died, literally in my arms. Nothing in my life
has so impressed me. It is true, as he said, that nothing is
worse than death. And when one reflects well that yet <i>that</i> is
the end of all, then there is nothing worse than life. Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
strive or try, since of what was Nicholas Tolstoy nothing
remains his? He did not say that he felt the approach of
death, but I know he watched each step of its approach and
knew with certainty how much remained. Some moments
before his death he drowsed off, but awoke suddenly and
whispered with horror: 'What is that?' That was when he
saw it&mdash;the absorption of himself into Nothingness. And if he
found nothing to cling to, what can I find? Still less! And
assuredly neither I nor any one will fight it to the last moment,
as he did. Two days before, I said to him: 'We ought to put
a commode in your room.'</p>

<p class="i2">'No,' said he, 'I am weak, but not yet so weak as that; I
will struggle on yet awhile.'</p>

<p class="i2">To the last he did not yield, but did everything for himself,
and always tried to be occupied. He wrote, questioned me
about my writings, and advised me. But it seemed to me that
he did all this not from any inner impulse, but on principle.
One thing&mdash;his love of Nature&mdash;remained to the last. The
day before, he went into his bedroom and from weakness fell
on his bed by the open window. I came to him, and he said
with tears in his eyes, 'How I have enjoyed this whole hour.'</p>

<p class="i2">From earth we come, and to the earth we go. One thing is
left&mdash;a dim hope that there, in Nature, of which we become
part in the earth, something will remain and will be found.</p>

<p class="i2">All who knew and saw his last moments, say: 'How
wonderfully calmly, peacefully he died'; but I know with
what terrible pain, for not one feeling of his escaped me.</p>

<p class="i2">A thousand times I say to myself: 'Let the dead bury their
dead.' One must make some use of the strength which
remains to one, but one cannot persuade a stone to fall
upwards instead of downwards whither it is drawn. One
cannot laugh at a joke one is weary of. One cannot eat when
one does not want to. And what is life all for, when to-morrow
the torments of death will begin, with all the abomination of
falsehood and self-deception, and will end in annihilation for
oneself? An amusing thing! Be useful, be beneficent, be
happy while life lasts,&mdash;say people to one another; but you,
and happiness, and virtue, and utility, consist of truth. And
the truth I have learned in thirty-two years is, that the posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>tion
in which we are placed is terrible. 'Take life as it is;
you have put yourselves in that position.' How! I take life as
it is. As soon as man reaches the highest degree of development,
he sees clearly that it is all nonsense and deception, and
that the truth&mdash;which he still loves better than all else&mdash;is
terrible. That when you look at it well and clearly, you
wake with a start and say with terror, as my brother did:
'What is that?'</p>

<p class="i2">Of course, so long as the desire to know and speak the truth
lasts, one tries to know and speak. That alone remains to me
of the moral world; higher than that I cannot place myself.
That alone I will do, but not in the form of your art. Art is
a lie, and I can no longer love a beautiful lie.</p>

<p class="i2">I shall remain here for the winter because I am here, and it
is all the same where one lives. Please write to me. I love
you as my brother loved you, and he remembered you to his
last moment.</p>

<p>A month later we find him writing in a different state
of mind:</p>

<p class="i2">A boy of thirteen has died in torment from consumption.
What for? The only explanation is given by faith in the compensation
of a future life. If that does not exist, there is no
justice, and justice is vain, and the demand for justice&mdash;a
superstition.</p>

<p class="i2">Justice forms the most essential demand of man to man.
And man looks for the same in his relation to the universe.
Without a future life it is lacking. Expediency is the sole, the
unalterable law of Nature, say the naturalists. But in the best
manifestations of man's soul: love and poetry&mdash;it is absent.
This has all existed and has died&mdash;often without expressing
itself. Nature, if her one law be expediency, far o'erstepped
her aim when she gave man the need of poetry and love.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty years later, in his <i>Confession</i>, Tolstoy
referred to his brother's death in the words:</p>

<p class="i2">Another event which showed me that the superstitious belief
in progress is insufficient as a guide to life, was my brother's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
death. Wise, good, serious, he fell ill while still a young man,
suffered for more than a year and died painfully, not understanding
why he had lived, and still less why he had to die.
No theories could give me, or him, any reply to these questions
during his slow and painful dying.</p>

<p>Any one who has read the works Tolstoy wrote during
the quarter of a century which succeeded his brother's
death, will be aware how long he remained in doubt on
this matter of a future life, and how he expressed now one,
and now another view.</p>

<p>At Hyères he continued to study the question of
education, and for that purpose made many visits to
Marseilles. He also wrote: continuing <i>The Cossacks</i> and
commencing an article on Popular Education. We get
a glimpse of him at this period from his sister, who tells
us that they had been invited to an At Home at Prince
Doundoukóf-Korsákof's; but Tolstoy, who was to have
been the lion of the occasion, failed to put in an appearance.
The company, which included all the 'best' people,
were getting dull, despite everything the hostess could
devise for their amusement, when at last, very late, Count
Tolstoy was announced. The hostess and her guests
immediately brightened up; but what was their astonishment
to see him appear in tourist garb and wearing
wooden <i>sabots</i>! He had been for a long walk, and returning
late, had come to the party without calling at his
lodgings; and no sooner was he in the room than he
began assuring everybody that wooden <i>sabots</i> were the very
best and most comfortable of foot-gear, and advising every
one to adopt them. Even in those days he was a man to
whom all things were allowed, and the evening, instead of
being spoilt, became all the gayer from his eccentricity.
There was a great deal of singing, and it fell to Tolstoy's
lot to accompany the singers.</p>

<p>At Hyères, after his brother's death, Tolstoy lived with
his sister and her three children in a <i>pension</i> where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
only other lodgers were a Madame Pláksin and her delicate
nine-year-old son Sergéy, whose lungs were thought to be
affected, but who lived to become a poet and to publish his
recollections of Tolstoy. Pláksin describes him as having
been at that time a strongly built, broad-shouldered man,
with a good-natured smile on his face, which was fringed
by a thick, dark-brown beard. Under a large forehead,
still bearing a deep scar from the wound inflicted by the
bear two years before, wise, kind eyes shone out of very
deep sockets. 'Tolstoy,' says Pláksin, 'was the soul of our
little society, and I never saw him dull; on the contrary,
he liked to amuse us with his stories, which were sometimes
extremely fantastic.' Tolstoy rose early, and while he was
at work the children were not allowed to disturb him
beyond running in for a moment to say 'good-morning.'
Being himself an indefatigable walker, Tolstoy used to
plan out excursions for the company, constantly discovering
new places to visit: the salterns on the peninsula of Porquerolle;
the holy hill where the chapel with the wonder-working
image of the Madonna stands; or the ruins of the
castle called <i>Trou des Fées</i>. They used to have with them
on these excursions, a small ass carrying provisions, fruit
and wine.</p>

<p class="i2">On the way Tolstoy used to tell us various tales; I remember
one about a golden horse and a giant tree, from the top of
which all the seas and all towns were visible. Knowing that
my lungs were delicate, he often took me on his shoulder and
continued his tale as he walked along. Need I say that we
would have laid down our lives for him?</p>

<p>At dinner-time Tolstoy used to tell the French proprietors
of the <i>pension</i> the strangest stories about Russia,
which they never knew whether or not to believe until
the Countess or Madame Pláksin came to their rescue by
separating the truth from the fiction.</p>

<p>After dinner, either on the terrace or indoors, a per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>formance
commenced, opera or ballet, to the sound of the
piano: the children 'mercilessly tormenting the ears of the
audience' (which consisted of the two ladies, Tolstoy, and
Pláksin's nurse). Next came gymnastic exercises, in which
Tolstoy acted as professor. 'He would lie at full length
on the floor, making us do the same, and we had then to
get up without using our hands.' He also contrived an
apparatus out of rope, which he fixed up in the doorway;
and on this he performed somersaults, to the great delight
of his juvenile audience.</p>

<p>When the latter became too turbulent and the ladies
begged Tolstoy to subdue the noise, he would set the children
round the table, and tell them to bring pens and ink.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the sort of occupation he
provided:</p>

<p class="i2">'Listen,' said he one day; 'I am going to give you a lesson.'</p>

<p class="i2">'What on?' demanded bright-eyed Lisa.</p>

<p class="i2">Disregarding his niece's question, he continued:</p>

<p class="i2">'Write...'</p>

<p class="i2">'But what are we to write, uncle?' persisted Lisa.</p>

<p class="i2">'Listen; I will give you a theme...!'</p>

<p class="i2">'What will you give us?'</p>

<p class="i2">'A theme!' firmly replied Tolstoy. 'In what respect does
Russia differ from other countries? Write it here, in my
presence, and don't copy from one another! Do you hear?'
added he, impressively.</p>

<p>In half an hour the 'compositions' were ready. Pláksin
had to read his own, as his lines were so irregular that
no one else could decipher them. In his opinion Russia
differed from other countries in that, at carnival time,
Russians eat pancakes and slide down ice-hills, and at
Easter they colour eggs.</p>

<p>'Bravo!' said Tolstoy, and proceeded to make out
Kólya's MS., in which Russia was distinguished by its
snow, and Lisa's, in which 'troikas' (three-horse conveyances)
played the chief part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>In reward for these evening exercises, Tolstoy brought
water-colour paints from Marseilles and taught the children
drawing.</p>

<p>He often spent nearly the whole day with the children,
teaching them, taking part in their games, and intervening
in their disputes, which he analysed, proving to them who
was in the right and who in the wrong.</p>

<p>There was at this time some mutual attraction between
Tolstoy and a young Russian lady, Miss Yákovlef, who was
staying at Hyères; but, like many other similar affairs, it
came to nothing.</p>

<p>On leaving Hyères, Tolstoy, his sister, and her children,
went to Geneva, and from thence he proceeded alone to
Nice, Leghorn, Florence, Rome, and Naples. In Italy he
says he experienced his first lively impression of antiquity;
but very little record remains of this journey, and it is
nowhere reflected in his writings.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris <i>viâ</i> Marseilles, the schools and
other institutions of which he observed closely, trying to
discover how man's intelligence is really best developed.</p>

<p>He was very unfavourably impressed by the popular
schools of Marseilles. The studies, he says, consisted in
learning by heart the Catechism, sacred and general
History, the four rules of Arithmetic, French spelling and
Book-keeping&mdash;the latter without sufficient comprehension
of the use of arithmetic to enable the children to deal
sensibly with the simplest practical problems requiring
addition and subtraction, though they could do long multiplication
sums quickly and well when only abstract figures
were given. Similarly, they answered well by rote questions
in French History, but, when asked at hazard, they
would give such answers as that Henry IV was killed by
Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>He observed the instruction given by the Churches, and
visited the adult schools of the town, as well as its <i>Salles
d'Asile</i>, in which, he says:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
I saw four-year-old children perform like soldiers, evolutions
round benches to orders given by whistle, and raise and
cross their arms to the word of command, and with strange
trembling voices sing hymns of praise to God and their benefactors;
and I became convinced that the educational establishments
of Marseilles were extremely bad.</p>

<p class="i2">Any one seeing them would naturally conclude that the
French people must be ignorant, coarse, hypocritical, full of
superstition and almost savage.</p>

<p class="i2">Yet one need only come in contact with and chat with any
of the common people, to convince oneself that on the contrary
the French people are almost what they consider themselves to
be: intelligent, clever, sociable, freethinking, and really civilised.
Take a workman of, say, thirty years of age: he will
write a letter without such mistakes as at school, sometimes
even quite correctly; he has some idea of politics, and therefore
of recent history and geography; he knows some history from
novels, knows something of natural history, and he very often
draws, and is able to apply mathematical formulae to his trade.
Where did he get all this?</p>

<p class="i2">I recently discovered the answer in Marseilles, by wandering
about the streets, drink-shops, <i>cafés chantants</i>, museums, workshops,
wharves and book-stalls. The very boy who told me
that Henry IV was killed by Julius Cæsar, knew the history of
<i>The Three Musketeers</i> and of <i>Monte Cristo</i> very well.</p>

<p>In Marseilles Tolstoy found that everybody had read
Dumas' works, of which there were twenty-eight cheap
editions. He estimated that each week, in the <i>cafés
chantants</i>, at least one-fifth of the population received oral
education, as the Greeks and Romans used to do. Comedies
and sketches were performed, verses declaimed, and the influence
for good or evil of this unconscious education far outweighed
that of the compulsory education given in schools.</p>


<h3>1861</h3>

<p>In January he reached Paris, where he spent a large
part of his time in omnibuses, amusing himself by
observing the people. He declares he never met a
passenger who was not represented in one or other of Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
de Kock's stories. Of that writer, as of Dumas <i>père</i>, he
thinks highly. 'Don't talk nonsense to me,' he once said,
'about Paul de Kock's immorality. He is, according to
English ideas, somewhat improper. He is more or less
what the French call <i>leste</i> and <i>gaulois</i>, but never immoral.
In everything he says, and despite his rather free jests, his
tendency is quite moral. He is a French Dickens.... As
to Dumas, every novelist should know him by heart. His
plots are admirable, not to mention the workmanship. I
can read and re-read him, though he aims chiefly at plots
and intrigue.'</p>

<p>In Paris he again met Tourgénef; and from France he
went on to London, where he remained six weeks, not
enjoying his visit much as he suffered severely from toothache
nearly all the time. It is characteristic of Tolstoy
that though he has often been a victim to toothache and
has also been much tried by digestive troubles, he never
appears to have had his teeth properly attended to by a
dentist. A dentist's establishment seems to him so unnatural
and artificial that it must be wrong. Moreover,
dentists do not always do their work well; and toothache&mdash;if
one endures it long enough&mdash;cures itself, and in
the past the majority of mankind have got along without
dentists. So he has been inclined to put up with toothache
as one of the ills it is best to bear patiently.</p>

<p>During his stay he, and Tourgénef who had also come
to London, saw a great deal of Alexander Herzen, who was
editing <i>Kólokol</i> (<i>The Bell</i>)&mdash;the most influential paper ever
published by a Russian exile.</p>

<p>I have already remarked on the fact that the Reform
movements of that time left Tolstoy curiously cold; and
here again it may be noted that though Tourgénef contributed
to Herzen's prohibited paper, Tolstoy never wrote
anything for it.</p>

<p>Herzen's little daughter, who had read and greatly
enjoyed <i>Childhood</i>, <i>Boyhood</i>, and <i>Youth</i>, hearing that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
author was coming to see her father, obtained permission
to be present when he called. She ensconced herself in an
arm-chair in a corner of the study at the appointed time,
and when Count Tolstoy was announced, awaited his
appearance with beating heart; but she was profoundly
disillusioned by the entrance of a man of society manners,
fashionably dressed in the latest style of English tailoring,
who began at once to tell with gusto of the cock-fights
and boxing-matches he had already managed to witness in
London. Not a single word with which she could sympathise
did she hear from Tolstoy throughout that one and
only occasion on which she was privileged to listen to his
conversation; and in this she was particularly unlucky, for
Tolstoy saw Herzen very frequently during his stay in
London, and the two discussed all sorts of important
questions together.</p>

<p>One of Herzen's closest friends and co-workers during
his long exile from Russia, was the poet N. P. Ogaryóf, who
had been his fellow-student at the Moscow University.
Ogaryóf, besides being a man of ability, possessed a very
amiable character that greatly endeared him to his friends;
but in an essay entitled <i>The First Step</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> written in 1892,
we get a glimpse of what alienated Tolstoy's sympathy
from the progressive movement these men represented.
He there says:</p>

<p class="i2">I have just been reading the letters of one of our highly
educated and advanced men of the forties, the exile Ogaryóf,
to another yet more highly educated and gifted man, Herzen.
In these letters Ogaryóf gives expression to his sincere
thoughts and highest aspirations, and one cannot fail to
see that&mdash;as was natural to a young man&mdash;he rather shows
off before his friend. He talks of self-perfecting, of sacred
friendship, love, the service of science, of humanity, and the
like. And at the same time he calmly writes that he often
irritates the companion of his life by, as he expresses it, 'return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>ing
home in an unsober state, or disappearing for many hours
with a fallen, but dear creature.'...</p>

<p class="i2">Evidently it never even occurred to this remarkably kind-hearted,
talented, and well-educated man that there was anything
at all objectionable in the fact that he, a married man,
awaiting the confinement of his wife (in his next letter he
writes that his wife has given birth to a child) returned home
intoxicated, and disappeared with dissolute women. It did
not enter his head that until he had commenced the struggle,
and had at least to some extent conquered his inclination to
drunkenness and fornication, he could not think of friendship
and love, and still less of serving any one or any thing. But
he not only did not struggle against these vices&mdash;he evidently
thought there was something very nice in them, and that they
did not in the least hinder the struggle for perfection; and
therefore instead of hiding them from the friend in whose eyes
he wishes to appear in a good light, he exhibits them.</p>

<p class="i2">Thus it was half a century ago. I was contemporary with
such men. I knew Ogaryóf and Herzen themselves and others
of that stamp, and men educated in the same traditions. There
was a remarkable absence of consistency in the lives of all these
men. Together with a sincere and ardent wish for good, there
was an utter looseness of personal desire, which, they thought,
could not hinder the living of a good life, nor the performance
of good and even great deeds. They put unkneaded loaves
into a cold oven, and believed that bread would be baked.
And then, when with advancing years they began to remark
that the bread did not bake&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that no good came of their
lives&mdash;they saw in this something peculiarly tragic.</p>

<p>This was written twenty years later; but it was latent
in his mind at the time, and furnishes a clue to the fact
that he never really made friends with these men.</p>

<p>Of Herzen as a writer Tolstoy ultimately came to have
a very high opinion, and admitted that he exerted a very
considerable influence on the mind of educated Russia.</p>

<p>In England, as elsewhere, Tolstoy saw as much as he
could of the educational methods in vogue. He also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
visited the House of Commons and heard Palmerston speak
for three hours; but he told me he could form no opinion
of the oration, for 'at that time I knew English with my
eyes but not with my ears.'</p>

<p>While in London, he received news that he had been
nominated Arbiter of the Peace for his own district, near
Toúla. The duties of the office were to settle disputes
between the serfs and their former proprietors. Except a
short service on the Zémstvo in 1874, this was the only
official position in which Tolstoy ever took much active
part after leaving the army.</p>

<p>On 3rd March (new style), the day of Alexander II's
famous Manifesto emancipating the serfs, Tolstoy left
London for Russia <i>viâ</i> Brussels. In that city he made
the acquaintance of Proudhon (the author of <i>Qu'est-ce que
la Propriété?</i> and a <i>Système des Contradictions Économiques</i>)
to whom Herzen had given him a letter of introduction.
Proudhon impressed Tolstoy as a strong man who had the
courage of his opinions; and though Proudhon's theories
had no immediate effect on Tolstoy's life, the social
political and economic views expounded by the latter a
quarter of a century later, are deeply dyed with Proudhonism.
Both writers consider that property is robbery;
interest immoral; peaceful anarchy the desirable culmination
of social progress, and that every man should be a law
unto himself, restrained solely by reason, conscience and
moral suasion. Another writer whose acquaintance Tolstoy
made in Brussels was the Polish patriot Lelewel, who had
taken a prominent part in the rebellion of 1830, and had
written on Polish history and on many other subjects. He
was at this time a decrepit old man living in great poverty.
While in Brussels Tolstoy wrote <i>Polikoúshka</i>, almost the
only story of his (besides <i>A Squire's Morning</i>) that implies
a condemnation of serfdom.</p>

<p>Passing through Germany, Tolstoy stopped at Weimar,
where he stayed with the Russian Ambassador, Von Mal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>titz,
and was introduced to the Grand Duke Carl Alexander.
Tolstoy (who had been reading Goethe's <i>Reineke Fuchs</i> not
long before) visited the house in which Goethe had lived,
but was more interested in a Kindergarten conducted by
Minna Schelholm, who had been trained by Froebel. From
another school he visited, we hear of his collecting and
carrying off the essays the pupils had written, explaining to
the master that he was much concerned with the problem,
'How to make thought flow more freely.'</p>

<p>At Jena he made acquaintance with a young mathematician
named Keller, whom he persuaded to accompany him
to Yásnaya to help him in his educational activities. He
also stopped at Dresden, where he again visited Auerbach,
concerning whom he jots down in his Diary:</p>

<p class="i2"><i>21 April, Dresden</i>: Auerbach is a most charming man.
Has given me a light.... He spoke of Christianity as the
spirit of humanity, than which there is nothing higher. He
reads verse enchantingly. Of Music as <i>Pflichtloser Genuss</i>
(dutyless pleasure).... He is 49 years old. Straightforward,
youthful, believing, not troubled by negation.</p>

<p>On another occasion Tolstoy expressed surprise at never
having seen Auerbach's <i>Village Tales of the Black Forest</i>
in any German peasant's house, and declared that Russian
peasants would have wept over such stories.</p>

<p>From Dresden he wrote to his Aunt Tatiána:</p>

<p class="i2"><a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Je me porte bien et brûle d'envie de retourner en Russie.
Mais une fois en Europe et ne sachant quand j'y retournerai,
vous comprenez que j'ai voulu profiter, autant que possible, de
mon voyage. Et je crois l'avoir fait. Je rapporte une si grande
quantité d'impressions, de connaissances, que je devrai tra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>vailler
longtemps, avant de pouvoir mettre tout cela en ordre
dans ma tête.</p>

<p class="i2">I am bringing with me a German from the University, to be
a teacher and clerk, a very nice, well-educated man, but still
very young and unpractical.</p>

<p>He adds that he intends to return to Yásnaya <i>viâ</i>
St. Petersburg, as he wants to obtain permission to publish
an educational magazine he is projecting.</p>

<p>On 22nd April he was already in Berlin, where he made
the acquaintance of the head of the Teachers' Seminary,
the son of the celebrated pedagogue Diesterweg, whom, to
his disappointment, he found to be 'a cold, soulless pedant,
who thinks he can develop and guide the souls of children
by rules and regulations.'</p>

<p>On 23rd April (old style) he re-entered Russia, after a
stay abroad of nearly ten months.</p>

<p>He brought with him complete editions of the works of
several of the greatest European writers. They were kept
at the Custom House to be submitted to the Censor, and,
as Tolstoy plaintively remarked nearly half a century later,
'he is still reading them!'</p>

AT YÁSNAYA AGAIN; TOURGÉNEF; ARBITER; MAGAZINE</h2>

<p class="i2">Quarrel with Tourgénef. Attitude towards Reforms. Arbiter
of the Peace. Educational Magazine.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">After</span> the winter's snow has so far thawed that sleighing is
impracticable, there comes a time during which there is still
too much snow left, and the roads have become too soft to
allow of travelling on wheels, and when transit is practically
impossible. Tolstoy reached Moscow at this transition period,
but had not to wait long before the roads were dry enough
for carriage traffic. He made the journey southward to
Toúla in company with Mrs. Fet, wife of his friend the poet.
Mrs. Fet was travelling in her own carriage, accompanied
by her maid, to the estate Fet had purchased at some
distance from Yásnaya. Tolstoy had his own conveyance,
but for company's sake changed places with the maid and
travelled with Mrs. Fet. In the cool of the evening he
borrowed and wrapped himself in a cloak of Fet's, declaring
that this would be sure to result in his producing a
lyric poem.</p>


<h3>1861</h3>

<p>Soon after reaching Yásnaya he wrote (in the third week
of May) to congratulate Fet on having become a
landed proprietor:</p>

<p class="i2">How long it is since we met, and how much has happened
to both of us meanwhile! I do not know how to rejoice
sufficiently when I hear or think of your activity as a farmer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and I am rather proud to have had at least some hand in the
matter.... It is good to have a friend; but he may die or
go away, or one may not be able to keep pace with him; but
Nature, to which one is wedded by a Notarial Deed, or to
which one has been born by inheritance, is still better. It is
one's own bit of Nature. She is cold, obdurate, disdainful and
exacting, but then she is a friend one does not lose till death,
and even then one will be absorbed into her. I am however
at present less devoted to this friend: I have other affairs that
attract me; yet but for the consciousness that she is there,
and that if I stumble she is at hand to hold on to&mdash;life would
be but a sad business.</p>

<p>A few days later, having received an invitation from
Tourgénef, Tolstoy paid him a visit the first hours of which
passed off to their mutual satisfaction. Tourgénef had
just finished his favourite novel, <i>Fathers and Sons</i>, and it
was arranged that after dinner Tolstoy was to read it and
give his opinion on it. To do this the more comfortably,
Tolstoy, left in the drawing-room by himself, lay down on
a large sofa. He began to read; but the story seemed to
him so artificially constructed and so unimportant in its
subject-matter, that he fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>'I awoke,' he narrates, 'with a strange sensation, and when
I opened my eyes I saw Tourgénef's back just disappearing.'</p>

<p>In spite of this occurrence and the unpleasant feeling it
occasioned, the two novelists set out next morning to visit
Fet, who was not expecting them that day.</p>

<p>While the visitors rested for a couple of hours, recovering
from the fatigue of their journey, Mrs. Fet saw to it
that the dinner assumed 'a more substantial and inviting
appearance.' During the meal the whole party began an
animated conversation, and Tourgénef, always fond of
good eating, fully appreciated the efforts Fet's excellent
man-cook had made. Champagne flowed, as was usual at
such reunions. After dinner the three friends strolled
to a wood a couple of hundred yards from the house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
lying down in the high grass at its outskirts, continued
their talk with yet more freedom and animation.</p>

<p>Next morning at the usual breakfast time, about eight
o'clock, the visitors entered the room where Mrs. Fet
presided at the samovár. Fet sat at the opposite end
of the table, Tourgénef at the hostess's right hand, and
Tolstoy at her left. Knowing the importance Tourgénef
attached to the education of his natural daughter, who
was being brought up in France, Mrs. Fet inquired
whether he was satisfied with her English governess.
Tourgénef praised the latter highly, and mentioned that,
with English exactitude, she had requested him to fix
the sum his daughter might give away in charity. 'And
now,' added Tourgénef, 'she requires my daughter to take
in hand and mend the tattered clothes of the poor.'</p>

<p>To Tolstoy, the foreign education Tourgénef was giving
his daughter, who was quite forgetting her own language,
was very distasteful; and his feeling no doubt showed
itself in his question:</p>

<p>'And you consider that good?'</p>

<p>'Certainly: it places the doer of charity in touch with
everyday needs.'</p>

<p>'And I consider that a well-dressed girl with dirty,
ill-smelling rags on her lap, is acting an insincere,
theatrical farce.'</p>

<p>'I beg you not to say that!' exclaimed Tourgénef,
with dilated nostrils.</p>

<p>'Why should I not say what I am convinced is true?'
replied Tolstoy.</p>

<p>'Then you consider that I educate my daughter badly?'</p>

<p>Tolstoy replied that his thought corresponded to his speech.</p>

<p>Before Fet could interpose, Tourgénef, white with rage,
exclaimed: 'If you speak in that way I will punch your
head!' and, jumping up from the table and seizing his
head in his hands, he rushed into the next room. A
second later he returned and, addressing Mrs. Fet, said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
'For heaven's sake excuse my improper conduct, which I
deeply regret!' and again left the room.</p>

<p>Fet, realising the impossibility of keeping his visitors
together after what had happened, was perplexed what to
do, for they had both arrived in Tourgénef's vehicle, and,
newly established in the country, Fet, though he had
horses, had none accustomed to be driven in the only
conveyance he possessed. To get Tourgénef off was easy;
but it was not without some difficulty and even danger from
the restive horses, that Tolstoy was conveyed to the nearest
post-station at which a hired conveyance could be procured.</p>

<p>From Novosélok, the first country house Tolstoy
reached, he wrote Tourgénef a letter demanding an
apology; and asked for an answer to be sent to the next
post-house at Bogousláf. Tourgénef, not noticing this
request, sent his reply to Fet's house, in consequence of
which it was several hours late in reaching Tolstoy&mdash;who
was so enraged at this (as it seemed to him) fresh act of
discourtesy, that from Bogousláf he sent a messenger to
procure pistols, and wrote a second letter containing a
challenge to Tourgénef, and stating that he did not wish
to fight in a merely formal manner, like literary men who
finish up with champagne, but that he was in earnest,
and hoped Tourgénef would meet him with pistols at the
outskirt of the Bogousláf woods.</p>

<p>That night was a sleepless one for Tolstoy. The morning
brought Tourgénef's reply to his first letter. It commenced
in the usual formal manner of polite communications:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Gracious Sir, Leo Nikoláyevitch!</span>&mdash;In reply to your letter,
I can only repeat, what I myself considered it my duty to
announce to you at Fet's: namely, that carried away by a
feeling of involuntary enmity, the causes of which need not
here be considered, I insulted you without any definite provocation;
and I asked your pardon. What happened this
morning proved clearly that attempts at intimacy between such
opposite natures as yours and mine can lead to no good result;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and I the more readily fulfil my duty to you, because the present
letter probably terminates our relations with one another.
I heartily hope it may satisfy you, and I consent in advance to
your making what use you please of it.</p>

<p class="i2">With perfect respect, I have the honour to remain, Gracious
Sir, your most humble servant,</p>

<p class="rightm"><span class="smcap">Iv. Tourgénef</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Spássky</span>, <i>27 May 1861</i>.</p>


<p class="i2"><i>P.S.</i> 10.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>:</p>

<p class="i2">Iván Petróvitch has just brought back my letter, which my
servant stupidly sent to Novosélok instead of to Bogousláf. I
humbly beg you to excuse this accidental and regrettable mistake,
and I hope my messenger will still find you at Bogousláf.</p>

<p>Tolstoy thereupon wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I could not resist opening another letter from Mr. Tourgénef
in reply to mine. I wish you well of your relations with that
man, but I despise him. I have written to him, and therewith
have terminated all relations, except that I hold myself ready to
give him any satisfaction he may desire. Notwithstanding all
my apparent tranquillity, I was disturbed in spirit and felt I must
demand a more explicit apology from Mr. Tourgénef; I did
this in my letter from Novosélok. Here is his answer, which
I accept as satisfactory, merely informing him that my reason
for excusing him is not our opposite natures, but one he may
himself surmise.</p>

<p class="i2">In consequence of the delay which occurred, I sent besides
this, another letter, harsh enough and containing a challenge,
to which I have not received any reply; but should I receive
one I shall return it unopened. So there is an end of that sad
story, which, if it goes beyond your house, should do so with
this addendum.</p>

<p>Tourgénef's reply to the challenge came to hand later,
and ran as follows:</p>

<p class="i2">Your servant says you desire a reply to your letter; but I
do not see what I can add to what I have already written;
unless it be that I admit your right to demand satisfaction,
weapons in hand. You have preferred to accept my spoken
and repeated apology. That was as you pleased. I will say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
without phrases, that I would willingly stand your fire in order
to efface my truly insane words. That I should have uttered
them is so unlike the habits of my whole life, that I can only
attribute my action to irritability evoked by the extreme and
constant antagonism of our views. This is not an apology&mdash;I
mean to say, not a justification&mdash;but an explanation. And
therefore, at parting from you for ever&mdash;for such occurrences
are indelible and irrevocable&mdash;I consider it my duty to repeat
once again that in this affair you were in the right and I in the
wrong. I add that what is here in question is not the courage I
wish, or do not wish, to show, but an acknowledgment of your
right to call me out to fight, in the accepted manner of course
(with seconds), as well as your right to pardon me. You have
chosen as you pleased, and I have only to submit to your decision.
I renew my assurance of my entire respect,</p>

<p class="rightm"><span class="smcap">Iv. Tourgénef</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">The quarrel was not, however, destined to die out so
quickly. Even good-natured Fet got into trouble by
trying to reconcile the irascible novelists. Here is one
of the notes he received from Tolstoy:</p>

<p class="i2">I request you not to write to me again, as I shall return
your letters, as well as Tourgénef's, unopened.</p>

<p>Fet remarks: 'So all my attempts to put the matter
right ended in a formal rupture of my relations with
Tolstoy, and I cannot now even remember how friendly
intercourse between us was renewed.'</p>

<p>Before four months had passed, Tolstoy repented him
of his quarrel. Like Prince Nehlúdof in <i>Resurrection</i>, he
used from time to time to repent of all his sins and all
his quarrels, and undertook a sort of spring- or autumn-cleaning
of his soul. It was at such a moment that, on
25th September, he wrote to Tourgénef expressing regret
that their relations to one another were hostile, and he
added: 'If I have insulted you, forgive me; I find it
unendurably hard to think I have an enemy.' Not knowing
Tourgénef's address in France, he sent this letter to a
bookseller in Petersburg (with whom he knew Tourgénef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
corresponded) to be forwarded. The letter took more
than three months to reach its destination, nor was
this the only thing that went wrong, as is shown by the
following portion of a letter, dated 8th November, from
Tourgénef to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">Apropos, 'one more last remark' about the unfortunate affair
with Tolstoy. Passing through Petersburg I learned from
certain 'reliable people' (Oh, those reliable people!) that
copies of Tolstoy's last letter to me (the letter in which he
'despises' me) are circulating in Moscow, and are said to have
been distributed by Tolstoy himself. That enraged me, and
I sent him a challenge to fight when I return to Russia. Tolstoy
has answered that the circulation of the copies is pure
invention, and he encloses another letter in which, recapitulating
that, and how, I insulted him, he asks my forgiveness
and declines my challenge. Of course the matter must
end there, and I will only ask you to tell him (for he writes
that he will consider any fresh communication from me to him
as an insult) that I myself repudiate any duel, etc., and hope
the whole matter is buried for ever. His letter (apologising)
I have destroyed. Another letter, which he says he sent me
through the bookseller Davídof, I never received. And now
as to the whole matter&mdash;<i>de profundis</i>.</p>

<p>Tolstoy noted in his Diary one day in October:</p>

<p class="i2">Yesterday I received a letter from Tourgénef in which he
accuses me of saying he is a coward and of circulating copies
of my letter. I have written him that it is nonsense, and
I have also sent him a letter: 'You call my action dishonourable
and you formerly wished to punch my head; but I consider
myself guilty, ask pardon, and refuse the challenge.'</p>


<h3>1862</h3>

<p>Even then the matter was not at an end, for on
7th January [new style?] Tourgénef writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">And now a plain question: Have you seen Tolstoy? I have
only to-day received the letter he sent me in September
through Davídof's bookshop (how accurate are our Russian merchants!).
In this letter he speaks of his intention to insult me,
and apologises, etc. And almost at that very time, in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>sequence
of some gossip about which I think I wrote you,
I sent him a challenge. From all this one must conclude that
our constellations move through space in definitely hostile conjunction,
and that therefore we had better, as he himself says,
avoid meeting. But you may write or tell him (if you see him)
that I (without phrase or joke) <i>from afar</i> love him very much,
respect him and watch his fate with sympathetic interest; but
that in proximity all takes a different turn. What's to be done?
We must live as though we inhabited different planets or
different centuries.</p>

<p>Tolstoy evidently took umbrage at Tourgénef's message,
and visited his wrath on Fet's innocent head. To be profoundly
humble and forgiving at his own command, was
always, it seems, easier for Tolstoy than to let his opponent
have an opinion of his own. Tolstoy likes things to be
quite clear-cut and definite, and it complicates matters to
have to reckon with any one else's views. At any rate
Tourgénef writes:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>14 Jan. [o.s.?] 1862</i>.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dearest Afanásy Afanásyevitch!</span> [Fet's Christian name
and patronymic].&mdash;First of all I must ask your pardon for the
quite unexpected tile (<i>tuile</i>, as the French say) that tumbled
on your head as a result of my letter. The one thing which
somewhat consoles me is that I could not possibly have
expected such a freak on Tolstoy's part, and thought I was
arranging all for the best. It seems it is a wound of a kind
better not touched at all.</p>

<p>To judge the relations between these two great writers
fairly, one must remember that Tourgénef was ten years
the elder and, until <i>War and Peace</i> appeared, ranked
higher in popular esteem; yet Tolstoy showed him no
deference, but on the contrary often attacked him and
his views with mordant irony. Tourgénef was neither ill-natured
nor quarrelsome. If Tolstoy had treated him with
consideration or had been willing to let him alone, there
would have been no question either of insult or of challenge.
But the younger man sought the elder's company, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
made himself disagreeable; and this, not of malice prepense,
but because it is his nature to demand perfection
from great men, and vehemently to attack those who fail
to reach the standard he sets up. This conduct was no
doubt all the more trying for Tourgénef, because Tolstoy
neither co-operated with the Liberal movement then current,
nor lived more abstemiously with regard to food, wine,
women, and cards than others of his set whom he scolded;
or if he did so, he did it so spasmodically and with such
serious lapses, as to be little entitled to condemn others
with the fervour he frequently displayed. On the occasion
of the great quarrel Tourgénef was certainly the aggressor,
and his prompt apology was not addressed to Tolstoy,
whom he had chiefly offended, but to Mrs. Fet. It is,
however, plain that he acted, as he said, on the irritable
impulse of the moment. Tolstoy aggravated matters by
sending a challenge before receiving a reply to his first
letter, and also by suggesting that he despised Tourgénef
and pardoned him for reasons 'he may himself surmise.'
Again, in relation to Fet, who merely wished to pour oil on
the troubled waters, Tolstoy showed a strange irritability.
No one however can read the <i>Recollections</i> Fet wrote
thirty years later, without seeing that that poet&mdash;who not
only witnessed this affair, but had been the confidant of
both writers for years&mdash;respected Tolstoy far more than he
respected Tourgénef.</p>

<p>In this whole story, one may detect traces of the qualities
which have made Tolstoy so interesting and so perplexing
a personality. He cares intensely about everything
with which he is occupied. Tourgénef, and Tourgénef's
opinions and conduct, were of tremendous importance to
him. So were his own views of how young ladies should
be brought up. So was the question whether he ought to
challenge his enemy; and, later on, the question whether he
ought to forgive him, and whether Fet should be allowed to
act as mediator. It is this fact&mdash;that he cares about things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a hundred times more than other people care about them&mdash;that
makes Tolstoy a genius and a great writer. What
was admirable in his conduct was not that he acted well
(as a matter of fact he acted very badly) but that he <i>wished</i>
to act well.</p>

<p>The same spirit which made him so intolerant with
Tourgénef: his strong feeling that 'To whom much is
given, of him much shall be required'&mdash;had something
to do, later in life, with his fierce attacks on Governments,
on Shakespear, on Wagner, and on other great
institutions and men. At the same time, the incident
throws light on that side of Tolstoy's character which has
brought it about that, despite the very real charm he
possesses, and despite the fact that many men and women
have been immensely attracted by his writings, he has had
very few intimate friends, and has constantly been misunderstood.</p>

<p>V. P. Bótkin, who was in touch both with Tolstoy and
Tourgénef, wrote to Fet after hearing of the quarrel:</p>

<p class="i2">The scene between him [Tourgénef] and Tolstoy at your
house, produced on me a sad impression. But do you know,
I believe that in reality Tolstoy has a passionately loving soul;
only he wants to love Tourgénef ardently, and unfortunately
his impulsive feeling encounters merely mild, good-natured indifference.
That is what he cannot reconcile himself to. And
then (again unfortunately) his mind is in a chaos, <i>i.e.</i> I wish to
say it has not yet reached any definite outlook on life and the
world's affairs. That is why his conviction changes so often, and
why he is so apt to run to extremes. His soul burns with unquenchable
thirst; I say 'unquenchable,' because what satisfied it
yesterday, is to-day broken up by his analysis. But that analysis
has no durable and firm reagents, and consequently its results
evaporate <i>ins blaue hinein</i>. Without some firm ground under
one's feet it is impossible to write. And that is why at present
he <i>cannot</i> write, and this will continue to be the case till his
soul finds something on which it can rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
To any one acquainted with the history of Russia at
that period, but not acquainted with Tolstoy's idiosyncrasies,
it must indeed seem strange that the story of his
life can be told with so little reference to the Emancipation
or the Reform movements of the years 1860-1864, to which
allusion has already been made. Two passages written
by him in 1904 state his relation to those movements
with the sincerity which is so prominent and valuable
a feature of his character:</p>

<p class="i2">As to my attitude at that time to the excited condition
of our whole society, I must say (and this is a good and bad
trait always characteristic of me) that I always involuntarily
opposed any external, epidemic pressure; and that if I was
excited and happy at that time, this proceeded from my own
personal, inner motives: those which drew me to my school
work and into touch with the peasants.</p>

<p class="i2">I recognise in myself now the same feeling of resistance
to the excitement at present prevailing; which resembles that
which, in a more timid form, was then current.</p>

<p>When the Emancipation came, the peasants received
freedom, and an allotment of land, subject to a special
land-tax for sixty years; while their masters retained the
rest of the land and received State Bonds for the capitalised
value of the peasants' land-tax. An expedient resorted to
by many a proprietor was, to allot land to the peasants in
such a way that the latter were left without any pasture,
and (being surrounded by the owner's estate) found themselves
obliged to hire pasture land of him on his own terms.
There were, till the Emancipation, two ways of holding
serfs: (1) the primitive way of obliging them to work
so many days a week for their master, before they could,
on the other days, provide for their own wants; and (2)
another way, which left the serf free to work for himself,
provided that he paid <i>obrók</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a certain yearly tribute to
his owner. These explanations will render intelligible the
second passage referred to above and quoted below:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Some three or four years before the Emancipation, I let my
serfs go on <i>obrók</i>. When complying with the Emancipation
Decree I arranged, as the law required, to leave the peasants
in possession of the land they were cultivating on their own
behalf, which amounted to rather less than eight acres per head,
and (to my shame be it said) I added nothing thereto. The
only thing I did&mdash;or the one evil I refrained from doing&mdash;was
that I abstained from obliging the peasants to exchange land
(as I was advised to do) and left them in possession of the
pasture they needed. In general, however, I did not show any
disinterested feeling in the affair.</p>

<p>In the first edition of <i>Tolstoy and his Problems</i> I
erroneously stated that Tolstoy, before the Decree of
Emancipation, voluntarily freed his serfs; and though this
was corrected in the second edition, it is necessary to
repeat the correction here, as the same mistake occurs in
the article on Tolstoy in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>. I
therefore quote the following passage from a letter he
wrote me on the subject:</p>

<p class="i2">I have received your book and read it with pleasure. The
short biography is excellent, except the place where you, quoting
the words of Sophia Andréyevna, say that 'he liberated his
peasants before the Emancipation.' That is wrong: I placed
them on <i>obrók</i> instead of keeping them on <i>bárstchina</i> [<i>i.e.</i> the
state in which the peasants rendered labour dues]. It would
not have been possible to emancipate them....</p>


<h3>1861</h3>

<p>Tolstoy's curious tendency to underrate the influence of
the Liberal reformers of that time, may be illustrated by
an incident that occurred at a dinner in Toúla.
The local elections had taken place, and a public
banquet was given in honour of those Arbiters of the
Peace who were visiting the town. Tolstoy was at this
dinner, and when the toast to the health of Alexander II,
the 'Tsar-Liberator,' was proposed, Tolstoy remarked to
his neighbour: 'I drink this toast with particular pleasure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
No others are needed, for in reality we owe the Emancipation
to the Emperor alone.'</p>

<p>A yet more curious instance of the same tendency occurs
in an article on <i>Progress, and the Definition of Education</i>,
which he published a year later, and in which, arguing that
printing has been of little use to the people, he says
that:</p>

<p class="i2">Even taking as an example the abolition of serfdom, I do
not see that printing helped the solution of the problem in a
progressive sense. Had the Government not said its decisive
word in that affair, the press would, beyond a doubt, have
explained matters in quite a different way to what it did. We
saw that most of the periodicals would have demanded the
emancipation of the peasants without any land, and would have
produced arguments apparently just as reasonable, witty and
sarcastic [as they actually produced in favour of the more
Liberal solution ultimately adopted]....</p>

<p>If, however, Tolstoy did not stand in the ranks of the
Reformers, he was much less of a partisan of his own class
than many of his fellow-nobles desired; and we find the
Marshal of the Nobility of Toúla writing to Valoúef,
Minister of Home Affairs, complaining of Tolstoy's appointment
as Arbiter of the Peace on the ground that he was
disliked by the neighbouring landowners. In consequence
of this complaint Valoúef made inquiries, and received a
'confidential' reply from the Governor of the Province,
stating that:</p>

<p class="i2">Knowing Count Tolstoy personally, as an educated man
warmly sympathising with the matter in hand, and in view of
a wish expressed to me by some of the proprietors of the
district that he should be appointed Arbiter, I cannot replace
him by some one I do not know.</p>

<p>Tolstoy tried his best to act fairly between peasants and
landowners; but from the start his unsuitability for duties
involving methodical care was obvious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
The very first 'charter,' regulating the relations between
a landlord and his newly-liberated peasants, that he sent
up to the Government Board for Peasant Affairs, was
signed as follows: 'At the request of such-and-such
peasants, because of their illiteracy, the house-serf so-and-so
has signed this charter for them.' Not a single name did
the charter contain! As Tolstoy had dictated the words,
so his servant had written them down, and the charter had
been sealed and sent off without being read over.</p>

<p>He could at times be wonderfully patient in dealing
with the peasants, though they were exasperatingly pertinacious
in demanding more than it was possible to grant.
An eye-witness tells how Tolstoy visited a neighbouring
estate on which differences had arisen between the peasants
and their former master, as to the land which should be
allotted to them. Tolstoy received a deputation, consisting
of three of the leading peasants of the village, and
asked them:</p>

<p>'Well, lads, what do you want?'</p>

<p>They explained what land they wished to have, and
Tolstoy replied, 'I am very sorry I can't do what you
wish. Were I to do so I should cause your landlord a
great loss'; and he proceeded to explain to them how the
matter stood.</p>

<p>'But you'll manage it for us somehow, <i>bátushka</i>'
[literally, 'little-father'], said the peasants.</p>

<p>'No, I can't do anything of the kind,' repeated Tolstoy.</p>

<p>The peasants glanced at one another, scratched their
heads, and reiterated their 'But somehow, <i>bátushka</i>!' and
one of them added, 'If only you want to, <i>bátushka</i>, you'll
know how to find a way to do it!' at which the other
peasants nodded their heads approvingly.</p>

<p>Tolstoy crossed himself, as orthodox Russians are wont
to do, and said: 'As God is holy, I swear that I can be of
no use at all to you.' But still the peasants repeated:
'You'll take pity on us, and do it somehow, <i>bátushka</i>!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Tolstoy at last turned vehemently to the steward, who
was present, and said: 'One can sooner, like Amphion,
move the hills and woods, than convince peasants of anything!'</p>

<p>The whole conversation, says the steward, lasted more
than an hour, and up to the last minute the Count retained
his patient and friendly manner towards the peasants.
Their obstinacy did not provoke him to utter a single
harsh word.</p>

<p>With the landowners Tolstoy had even more trouble
than with the peasants. He received many threatening
letters, plans were formed to have him beaten, he was to
have been challenged to a duel; and denunciations against
him were sent to those in authority.</p>

<p>After some three months of the work, in July 1861, he
jotted down in his Diary: 'Arbitration has given me but
little material [for literary work], has brought me into
conflict with all the landed-proprietors, and has upset my
health.'</p>

<p>Here is a sample of the cases he had to deal with. A
Mrs. Artukóf complained that a certain Mark Grigóref
(who had been a house-serf, and was therefore not entitled
to land) had left her, considering himself to be 'perfectly
free.'</p>

<p>Tolstoy, in his reply to the lady, said:</p>

<p class="i2">Mark, by my order, is at liberty to go immediately, with his
wife, where he likes; and I beg you (1) to compensate him for
the three-and-a-half months he has been illegally kept at work
by you since the Decree was published, and (2) for the blows
still more illegally inflicted on his wife. If my decision displeases
you, you have a right of appeal to the Magistrates'
Sessions and to the Government Sessions. I shall not enter
into further explanations on this subject.&mdash;With entire respect
I have the honour to remain, your humble servant,</p>

<p class="rightm">C<sup>t.</sup> L. <span class="smcap">Tolstoy.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The lady appealed to the Magistrates' Sessions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Tolstoy's decision was annulled; but on the case being
carried to the Government Sessions, his view of the case
prevailed.</p>

<p>Before he had been a year in office we find him writing
to the Government of the Toúla Board of Peasant Affairs
as follows:</p>

<p class="i2">As the complaints [here follows a list of several cases] lodged
against my decisions have no legal justification, but yet in
these and many other cases my decisions have been and are
being repealed, so that almost every decision I give is subsequently
reversed; and as under such conditions&mdash;destructive
both of the peasants' and the landowners' confidence in the
Arbiter&mdash;the latter's activity becomes not merely useless but
impossible, I humbly request the Government Board to authorise
one of its members to hasten the examination of the above-mentioned
appeals, and I have to inform the Government
Board that until such investigations are completed I do not
consider it proper that I should exercise the duties of
my office, which I have, therefore, handed over to the senior
Candidate.</p>

<p>The following month he resumed official work, but six
weeks later, on 30th April 1862, on the score of ill-health,
he handed the duties over to a substitute; and on 26th
May&mdash;about a year after he had first assumed the office&mdash;the
Senate informed the Governor of Toúla that it 'had
decided to discharge the Lieutenant of Artillery, Count
Leo Tolstoy, on the ground of ill-health' from the post
of Arbiter of the Peace.</p>

<p>His unsatisfactory experience of administrative work no
doubt helps to account for the anti-Governmental bias
shown in his later works. Even at this time, he quite
shared the dislike of civil and criminal law expressed by
Rousseau when he wrote in his <i>Confession</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">The justice and the inutility of my appeals left in my mind
a germ of indignation against our stupid civil institutions, in
which the true welfare of the public, and veritable justice, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
always sacrificed to I know not what apparent order, really
destructive of all order, and which merely adds the sanction of
public authority to the oppression of the weak and the iniquity
of the strong.</p>

<p>We may at any rate be sure that tiresome, petty administrative
work, never quite satisfactory, but at best consisting
of compromises and of decisions based on necessity
rather than on such principles of abstract justice as are
dear to Tolstoy's soul, could never be an occupation satisfactory
to him. He has not the plodding patience and
studious moderation that such work demands; nor could
his impulsive genius find scope in it. It has never been
easy for him to be checked by others, or to have to reckon
with their opinions and wishes. Like Rousseau, it suits
him better to reform the world on paper, or even to alter
his own personal habits of life, than to concern himself
with the slow social progress, the bit-by-bit amelioration,
which alone is possible to those harnessed to the car that
carries a whole society of men.</p>

<p>Tolstoy used at this time to find recreation in hunting,
and often went out for days together with his friend and
relation Prince D. D. Obolénsky, who describes him as
having been a bold and active hunter, leaping all sorts of
obstacles, and a wonderful man to talk to.</p>

<p>Concurrently with his duties as Arbiter, Tolstoy had
been carrying on an enterprise in which he had to deal
with people younger and more easy to mould than the
peasants and proprietors whose quarrels he found it so
hard to adjust; and during the winter of 1861-1862 he
devoted himself with especial fervour to the task of educating
the peasant children of Yásnaya and the surrounding
district.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, a chief aim of his travels
abroad had been to study the theory and practice of education;
and not only did he now personally devote himself to
the school at Yásnaya, but in the surrounding neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
eleven similar schools were soon started, all more or less
inspired by his ideals and encouraged by his co-operation.
The monthly magazine, <i>Yásnaya Polyána</i> (now a bibliographical
rarity) which he produced and edited during
1862, aimed at propagating his theories of education and
making known the results attained in his school, and it also
contained an account of sums voluntarily contributed
for its support. From articles published in it (and republished
in his collected writings) we get a vivid description
of the work carried on in November and December
1861.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Like many Russian magazines, <i>Yásnaya Polyána</i>
always appeared late, and, to begin with, the January
number was several weeks behind time.</p>

<p>In this educational work, Tolstoy showed the qualities
and limitations which in later years marked all his propagandist
activity. There was the same characteristic
selection of a task of great importance; the same readiness
to sweep aside and condemn nearly all that civilised
humanity had accomplished up to then; the same assurance
that he could untie the Gordian knot; and the same
power of devoted genius enabling him really to achieve
much more than one would have supposed possible, though
not a tithe of what he set himself to do.</p>

<p>In later life Tolstoy laid no particular emphasis on what
he wrote in these educational articles: in fact, we shall
find him sometimes speaking very scornfully of them; but
they throw so much light on his then state of mind, and
often come so near to the views he strongly advocated
twenty or thirty years later, that it will be worth devoting
a good deal of attention to them.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, then, defines Education as: <i>a human activity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
aving for its basis a desire for equality, and the constant
tendency to advance in knowledge</i>. This he illustrates by
saying that the aim of a teacher of arithmetic should be to
enable his pupil to grasp all the laws of mathematical
reasoning he himself is master of; the aim of a teacher of
French, or chemistry, or philosophy, should be similar; and
as soon as that aim is attained, the activity will naturally
cease. Everywhere and always, teaching which makes the
pupil the master's equal, has been considered good. The
more nearly and rapidly this is accomplished, the better; the
less nearly and more slowly it is accomplished, the worse.
Similarly in literature (an indirect method of teaching)
those books are written best, in which the author succeeds
in transmitting his whole message most easily to the
reader.</p>

<p>By 'the constant tendency to advance in knowledge,'
Tolstoy meant that the equality aimed at in education can
only be obtained on the higher, and not on the lower,
level: that is to say, not by the teacher forgetting
what he knows, but by the pupil acquiring the teacher's
knowledge. Much tuition however is based not on
the desire to equalise knowledge, but on quite false
foundations.</p>

<p>These are: (1) First and commonest, the child learns in
order not to be punished; (2) the child learns in order to
earn a reward; (3) the child learns in order to be better
than others; (4) the child, or young man, learns in order
to obtain an advantageous position in the world....</p>

<p>With reference to the practice of sending boys to school,
not for their natural development, but that they may be
moulded into a set form, Tolstoy declares that 'Education,
as a deliberate moulding of people into certain forms, is
<i>sterile, illegitimate, and impossible</i>.'</p>

<p>Of examinations he strongly disapproves, as tending to
arbitrariness on the side of the examiners, and deception
on the side of the pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Under what circumstances, asks Tolstoy, can a pupil
acquire knowledge most rapidly? 'A child or a man is
receptive only when he is aroused; and therefore to regard
a merry spirit in school as an enemy or a hindrance, is the
crudest of blunders.</p>

<p>The pupil's state of mind is the most important condition
of successful education; and to secure good results,
freedom is indispensable. No child should be forced to
learn what it does not want to, or when it does not
wish to.</p>

<p class="i2">One need only glance at one and the same child at home or
in the street, and at school. Here you see a vivacious, inquisitive
being, with a smile in his eye and on his mouth, seeking
information everywhere as a pleasure, and clearly, and often
forcibly, expressing his thoughts in his own way; while there
you see a weary, shrinking creature repeating, merely with his
lips, some one else's thoughts in some one else's words, with an
air of fatigue, fear and listlessness: a creature whose soul has
retreated like a snail into its shell. One need but glance at
these two conditions to see which of them is the more conducive
to the child's development. That strange physiological
condition which I call the 'School state of mind,' and which
unfortunately we all know so well, consists in all the higher
capacities: imagination, creative power and reflection, yielding
place to a semi-animal capacity to pronounce words without
imagination or reflection.</p>

<p>When the pupils have been reduced to this 'School state
of mind' we encounter those 'not accidental, but often-repeated
cases,' of the stupidest boy being at the top of
the class, and the cleverest boy at the bottom.</p>

<p>In short, a child's mental capacities are really active
only when that child is free; and the teacher's chief task
lies 'in studying the free child' and discovering how to
supply him with knowledge. Therefore 'the only method
of education is experiment, and its only criterion is
<i>freedom</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
The attempts to enforce obedience and quiet in school-rooms,
converts schools into places of torture which
have a stupefying effect, well called by the Germans
<i>Verdummen</i>.</p>

<p class="i2">In Germany nine-tenths of those who pass through the
primary schools leave them possessed of an ability to read and
write mechanically, but imbued with so strong a loathing for
the experience they have had of the paths of knowledge, that
they subsequently never take a book in their hands. Let
those who doubt what I say, point out to me what books are
read by the labourers.... No one who will seriously consider
the education of the people, not only in Russia but also in the
rest of Europe, can help coming to the conclusion that the
people get their mental development quite independently of a
knowledge of reading and writing, and that usually, except in
a few cases of exceptional ability, these rudiments remain a
quite unapplied art&mdash;which is even harmful, since nothing in
life can remain indifferent....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="i2">Schools are not so arranged as to make it convenient for
children to learn, but so as to make it convenient for teachers
to teach. The voices, movements and mirth of the children,
which form a necessary condition of their studying successfully,
incommode the teachers, and therefore in the prison-like
schools of to-day, questions, conversation, and movement are
forbidden.</p>

<p>Schools based on compulsion, supply 'not a shepherd for
the flock, but a flock for the shepherd.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="i2">To deal successfully with any object, it is necessary to study
it, and in education the object is a free child; yet the pedagogues
wish to teach in their own way&mdash;the way that seems
good in their own eyes; and when this does not act, they want
not to alter their way of teaching but the nature of the child.
...Not till experiment becomes the basis of the School, and
every school is, so to say, a pedagogic laboratory, will schools
cease to lag behind the general level of the world's progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
For boarding-schools Tolstoy had scant respect:</p>

<p class="i2">At home all the comforts of life&mdash;water, fires, good food,
a well-cooked dinner, the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms&mdash;all
depended on the work and care of the mother and of the
whole family. The more work and care, the greater the comfort;
the less work and care, the less comfort. A simple
matter this no doubt, but more educational I think, than the
French language or a knowledge of Alexander the Great.
In a boarding-school, this constant vital reward for labour is
so put out of sight, that not only is the dinner no better
or worse, the napkins no cleaner or dirtier, and the floors
no brighter or duller, because of the girl's exertion or non-exertion,
but she has not even a cell or corner of her own to
keep straight or leave untidy at her pleasure, and she has no
chance of making a costume for herself out of scraps and
ribbons.</p>

<p>His general charge against day-schools, boarding-schools
and universities alike is that:</p>

<p class="i2">At the base of them all lies one and the same principle: the
right of one man, or of a small group of men, to shape other
people as they like.</p>

<p>He adds that:</p>

<p class="i2">It is not enough for School to tear children away from real life
for six hours a day during the best years of their life: it wishes
to tear three-year-old children from their mother's influence.
Institutions have been contrived (<i>Kleinkinderbervahranstalten</i>,
infant schools, <i>salles d'asile</i>) about which we shall have to speak
more in detail later on. It only remains to invent a steam-engine
which will replace the nursing mother! All agree that
schools are imperfect; I, personally, am convinced that they
are noxious.</p>

<p>He argues that no man or set of men has any right to
force any particular kind of education on any one else.
The teacher has no right to do more than offer such
knowledge as he possesses, and he should respect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
child's right to reject it as indigestible, or as badly
served up:</p>

<p class="i2">On what grounds does the School of to-day teach this and
not that, and in this and not that way?</p>

<p class="i2">Where, in our day, can we get such faith in the indubitability
of our knowledge as would give us a right to educate
people compulsorily? Take any medieval school, before or
after Luther, take the whole scholastic literature of the Middle
Ages, what a strength of belief and what a firm, indubitable
knowledge of what was true and what was false, we see in
them! It was easy for them to know that a knowledge of
Greek was the one essential condition of education; for
Aristotle's works were in Greek, and no one doubted the
truth of his propositions till centuries later. How could the
monks help demanding the study of the Holy Scriptures,
which stood on an immovable foundation? It was well for
Luther to demand the compulsory study of Hebrew, being
sure, as he was, that in that language God himself has revealed
the truth to man. Evidently, as long as man's critical sense
was not aroused, the school had to be dogmatic; and it was
natural for pupils to learn by heart the truths revealed by God,
as well as Aristotle's science and the poetic beauties of Virgil
and Cicero. For centuries after, no one could imagine any
truer truth, or more beautiful beauty. But what is the position
of the schools of our time, which retain these same dogmatic
principles, while in the room next the class where the immortality
of the soul is taught, it is suggested to the pupils
that the nerves common to man and to the frog are what was
formerly called 'the soul'; and where after hearing the story
of Joshua the son of Nun read to him without explanations,
the pupil learns that the sun never did go round the earth;
and when after the beauties of Virgil have been explained to
him, he finds the beauties of Alexandre Dumas (whose novels
he can buy for sixpence) much greater; when the only belief
held by the teacher is that nothing is true, but that whatever
exists is reasonable; and that progress is good and backwardness
bad, though nobody knows in what this progress, that is so
generally believed in, consists?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
In another article he says:</p>

<p class="i2">Luther insists on teaching the Holy Scriptures from the
originals, and not from the commentaries of the Fathers of the
Church. Bacon enjoins the study of Nature from Nature, and
not from the books of Aristotle. Rousseau wants to teach
life from life itself as he understands it, and not from previous
experiments. Each step forward in the philosophy of pedagogics
merely consists in freeing the schools from the idea
of teaching the younger generations what the elder generations
believed to be science, and in substituting studies that accord
with the needs of the younger generations.</p>

<p>Again, he says</p>

<p class="i2">It is very usual to read and hear it said that the home
conditions, the coarseness of parents, field labour, village
games and so forth, are the chief hindrances to school-work.
Possibly they really interfere with the kind of school-work
aimed at by the pedagogues; but it is time we understood
that those conditions are the chief bases of all education, and
far from being inimical to, or hindrances of the School, are its
first and chief motive power.... The wish to know anything
whatever, and the very questions to which it is the School's
business to reply, arise entirely from these home conditions.
All instruction should be simply a reply to questions put by
life. But School, far from evoking questions, fails even to
answer those which life suggests.... To such questions the
child receives no reply; more especially as the police regulations
of the School do not allow him to open his mouth, even when he
wants to be let out for a minute, but obliges him to make signs
in order not to break the silence or disturb the teacher.</p>

<p>The great questions, Tolstoy says, are: (1) What must
I teach? and (2) How must I teach it? He remarks
that a couple of centuries ago, neither in Russia nor in
Western Europe could these questions have arisen.
Education was then bound up with religion, and to
become a scholar meant to learn the Scriptures. In
Mohammedan countries this union of religion with educa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>tion
still exists in full force. To learn, means to learn
the Koran, and therefore to learn Arabic. But as soon as
the criterion of what to learn ceased to be religion, and
the School became independent of the Church, the question
of what to teach was bound to arise. That it did not arise
suddenly, was due to the fact that the emancipation of
the School from the Church took place gradually. But
the day has at last come when the question must be faced;
and no clear guidance is given us either by philosophy
or by any definite consensus of opinion among those
concerned with education. In the higher schools some
advocate a classical, others a scientific, education; while
in the primary schools, if the education is controlled by
the priests it is carried on in one way, and if it is controlled
by the anti-clericals it is carried on in another.
Under these circumstances the only possible criterion must
be the wish of the pupils or of their parents. Tolstoy
then goes on to maintain that the demand of the mass of
the Russian people is for tuition in the Russian and
Ecclesiastico-Slavonic languages, and for mathematics.</p>

<p>As to <i>how</i> to teach, he contends that this resolves
itself into the question, How to establish the best possible
relations between those who want to learn and those who
want to teach, and he says:</p>

<p class="i2">No one, probably, will deny that the best relation between
a teacher and his pupils is a natural one, and that the opposite
to a natural one is a compulsory one. If that be so, then the
measure of all scholastic methods consists in the greater or
lesser naturalness, and consequently in the less or more
compulsion employed. The less the children are compelled,
the better is the method; the more they are compelled, the
worse is the method. I am glad that it is not necessary for
me to prove this obvious truth. All are agreed that it cannot
be good for health to employ foods, medicines, or exercises
which create disgust or pain; and so also in learning, there can
be no need to compel children to grind at anything dull or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
repugnant to them; and if it seems necessary to use compulsion,
that fact can merely prove the imperfection of the
methods employed. All who have taught children have
probably noticed that the worse the teacher knows the subject
he is dealing with and the less he likes it, the more he has to
be stern and the more compulsion he has to use; while on the
contrary, the better the teacher knows and loves his subject,
the more free and natural will be his tuition.</p>

<p class="i2">If history be closely examined, it will be found that every
advance in pedagogics has consisted merely in a diminution of
compulsion, a facilitation of study, and a greater and greater approach
to naturalness in the relations between teacher and pupil.</p>

<p class="i2">People have asked, How can we find the degree of freedom
to be allowed in school? To which I reply that the limit of
that freedom is naturally defined by the teacher, by his knowledge,
and by his capacity to manage the school. Such
freedom cannot be dictated; its measure is merely the result
of the greater or lesser knowledge and talent possessed by the
master. Freedom is not a rule, but it serves as a gauge when
comparing one school with another, or when judging of new
methods. The school in which there is less compulsion, is
better than the one in which there is more. That method
is good which, when introduced into a school, does not
necessitate any increase of discipline; while that is certainly
bad which necessitates greater severity.</p>

<p>From his main subject of Education, Tolstoy digresses
in these articles into a discussion of other problems, in a
way which reminds one of those wonderful essays he began
to pour forth a quarter of a century later.</p>

<p>That he had been somewhat influenced by the Slavophils
is indicated by his readiness to assume that Russia may
advance along a line of her own, entirely different to that
the Western nations have travelled. 'Progress,' in which
like almost all his contemporaries he had believed, he
now questions; and he indulges in a sharp attack on
Macaulay for the third chapter of his <i>History</i>, which he
says contains no proof that any real progress has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
achieved. Buckle, similarly, is roughly handled for the
assumption of progress that underlies his <i>History of
Civilisation</i>; but most scathing of all is his onslaught
upon Hegel, who (till Darwin appeared) was the rock on
which many of the intellectual Liberals took their stand.</p>

<p class="i2">From the time of Hegel and his famous aphorism: 'What
is historic is reasonable,' a very queer mental hocus-pocus has prevailed
in literary and in verbal disputes, especially among us,
under the name of 'the historic view.' You say, for instance, that
man has a right to freedom, or to be tried on the basis of laws of
which he himself approves; but the historic view replies that
history evolves a certain historic moment conditioning a certain
historic legislation and a people's historic relation thereto.
You say you believe in a God; and the historic view replies
that history evolves certain historic views and humanity's
relation to those views. You say the <i>Iliad</i> is the greatest of
epic works; and the historic view replies that the <i>Iliad</i> is
merely the expression of the historic consciousness of a people
at a certain historic moment. On this basis, the historic view
does not dispute with you as to whether man needs freedom,
or whether there is or is not a God, or whether the <i>Iliad</i> is good
or bad: it does nothing to establish the freedom you desire;
to persuade or dissuade you of the existence of a God or of the
beauty of the <i>Iliad</i>; it merely points out to you the place your
inner need or your love of truth or beauty, occupy in history.
It merely recognises&mdash;and recognises not by direct cognition,
but by historic ratiocination.</p>

<p class="i2">Say that you love or believe anything, and the historic view
tells you: 'Love and believe, and your love and faith will find
their place in our historic view. Ages will pass and we shall
find the place you are to occupy in history. Know however in
advance, that what you love is not absolutely beautiful, and what
you believe in is not absolutely true; yet amuse yourselves, children:
your love and faith will find their place and application.'</p>

<p class="i2">It is only necessary to add the word 'historic' to any conception
you like, and that conception loses its real vital
meaning, in an artificially-formed historic world-conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Of the introduction of telegraphs and railways he
remarks that people attribute great importance to these
inventions, and boast of the progress that is being made,
declaring that:</p>

<p class="i2">'Man is mastering the forces of Nature. Thought, with the
rapidity of lightning, flies from one end of the world to the
other. Time is vanquished.'</p>

<p>This, says Tolstoy, is excellent and touching.</p>

<p class="i2">But let us see who gains by it. We are speaking of the
progress of the electric telegraph. Evidently the advantage
and use of the telegraph is reserved for the upper, so-called
'educated' class; while the people, nine-tenths of the whole,
only hear the droning of the wires and are hampered by the
strict laws made for the protection of the telegraph.</p>

<p class="i2">Along the wires flies the thought that the demand for such-and-such
an article has increased, and that the price must
therefore be raised; or the thought that I, a Russian landed
proprietress, living in Florence, have, thank God, recovered from
my nervous prostration, and that I embrace my adored husband
and beg him to send me 40,000 francs as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="i2">Without going into exact statistics of the messages sent,
one may be quite sure that they all belong to the kind of
correspondence of which the above are samples. No peasant
of Yásnaya Polyána in the Government of Toúla, or any other
Russian peasant (and let it not be forgotten that the peasants
form the mass of the people whose welfare 'progress' is
supposed to secure) ever has sent or received, or for a long
time to come will either send or receive, a single telegram.
All the messages that fly above his head add no jot to his
welfare, because all he needs he gets from his own fields and
his own woods, and he is equally indifferent to the cheapness
or dearness of sugar or cotton, to the dethronement of King
Otho, the speeches of Palmerston and Napoleon III, or the
feelings of the lady in Florence. All those thoughts that fly
with the rapidity of lightning round the world, do not increase
the fertility of his fields nor diminish the strictness of the
keepers in the squire's or the Crown's forests, nor do they add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to his or his family's working power, or supply him with
an extra labourer. All these great thoughts may impair his
welfare, but cannot secure or further it, and can have but a
negative interest for him. To the True-Believers in progress,
however, the telegraph wires have brought and are bringing
immense advantages. I do not deny those advantages: I only
wish to prove that one must not think, or persuade others,
that what is advantageous for me, is a great blessing to all the
world....</p>

<p class="i2">In the opinion of the Russian people what increases their
welfare is an increase of the fertility of the soil, an increase in
the herds of cattle, an increase of the quantity of grain and its
consequently becoming cheaper, an increase of working power,
an increase in woods and pastures, and the absence of town
temptations. (I beg the reader to observe that no peasant
ever complains of the cheapness of bread; it is only the
political economists of Western Europe who soothe him with
the prospect that bread will become dearer and render it more
possible for him to purchase manufactured articles, in which he
is not interested.)</p>

<p class="i2">Which of these benefits does the railway bring to the
peasant? It increases the temptations; it destroys the woods;
it draws away labourers; it raises the price of grain....</p>

<p class="i2">The real people, that is to say those who themselves work
and live productively&mdash;nine-tenths of the whole nation&mdash;without
whom no progress is conceivable, are always hostile to the
railway. And so what it comes to is this: that the believers
in 'progress,' a small part of society, say that railways increase
the welfare of the people; while the larger part of the nation
say that the railways decrease it.</p>

<p>Interesting, stimulating and suggestive as Tolstoy's
articles were, and valuable as was the experience gained in
his school, his magazine had very few subscribers and only
existed for one year: the twelfth number was the last.</p>

<p>In an article written thirteen years later, he says of his
attempts in 1861-2:</p>

<p class="i2">At that time I met with no sympathy in the educational
journals, nor even with any contradiction, but only with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
completest indifference to the question I was raising. There
were, it is true, some attacks on a few insignificant details, but
the question itself evidently interested no one. I was young
at that time, and this indifference galled me. I did not understand
that I with my question: How do you know what and
how to teach? was like a man who, in an assembly of Turkish
Pachas discussing how to collect more taxes from the people,
should say to them: Gentlemen, before discussing how much
to take from each man, we must first consider what right we
have to collect taxes at all? Obviously, the Pachas would
continue to discuss the methods of collecting, and would ignore
the irrelevant question.</p>

<p>Before passing on to tell of the actual working of the
Yásnaya Polyána school, there is one matter to be noted,
small indeed in itself, but characteristic, and helpful for the
understanding of Tolstoy's later development.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's personal honour has never been questioned,
and the reader will remember that at Sevastopol he flatly
refused to touch money which, according to the long-standing
regimental custom, was at his disposal. Well, in his
magazine he printed a story written by one of the boys
in the school, and appraised it with enthusiasm. The hero
of the story, who had been wretchedly poor, returns from
the army with money to spare, and explains the matter
to his wife by saying: 'I was a non-commissioned officer
and had Crown money to pay out to the soldiers, and
some remaining over, I kept it.'</p>

<p>Commenting on this, Tolstoy says:</p>

<p class="i2">It is revealed that the soldier has become rich, and has done
so in the simplest and most natural manner, just as almost
everybody does who becomes rich&mdash;that is, by other people's,
the Crown's, or somebody's, money remaining in his hands owing
to a fortunate accident. Some readers have remarked that this
incident is immoral, and that the people's conception of the
Crown as a milch cow should be eradicated and not confirmed.
But not to speak of its artistic truth, I particularly value that
trait in the story. Does not the Crown money always stop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
somewhere? And why should it not, once in a way, stop with
a homeless soldier like Gordéy?</p>

<p class="i2">In the views of honesty held by the peasants and the upper
class, a complete contrast is often noticeable. The peasants'
demands are specially serious and strict with regard to honesty
in the nearest relations of life; for instance, in respect to one's
family, one's village, or one's commune. In respect to outsiders:
the public, the Crown, or foreigners, or the Treasury
especially, the applicability of the rules of honesty seems to
them obscure. A peasant who would never tell a lie to his
brother peasant, and who would bear all possible hardships for
the sake of his family, and not take a farthing from a fellow-villager
or neighbour without having fully earned it&mdash;will be
ready to squeeze a foreigner or a townsman like an orange, and
at every second word will lie to a gentleman or an official. If
he is a soldier, he will without the slightest twinge of conscience
stab a French prisoner, and should Crown money come his way,
he would consider it a crime to his family not to take it. In the
upper class, on the contrary, it is quite the reverse.... I do not
say which is better, I only say what I believe to be the case....</p>

<p class="i2">To return to the story. The mention of the Crown money,
which at first seems immoral, in our opinion has a most sweet
and touching character. How often a writer of our circle,
when wishing to show his hero as an ideal of honesty, naïvely
displays to us the dirty and depraved nature of his own imagination!
Here, on the contrary, the author has to make his hero
happy. His return to his family would suffice for that, but it
was also necessary to remove the poverty which for so many
years had weighed on the family. Where was he to take money
from? From the impersonal Crown! If the author is to
give him wealth, it has to be taken from some one, and it
could not have been found in a more legitimate or reasonable
way.</p>

<p>No doubt Tolstoy's statement of peasant morality is
true enough; but Tolstoy's attitude towards the matter
is remarkable. He has always had a keen sense of personal
morality, but when public morality was in question, his
decisions seem to me often to have been at fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Passing from the moral to the economic aspect of the
question, to Western ears it sounds strange to hear the
medieval or Oriental conception so boldly announced, that
property 'has to be taken from some one' before it can
be obtained. In our world, wealth has, during the last
five generations, been increased enormously by inventions,
by organisation, by division of labour, by the skilful utilisation
of the forces of Nature, as well as by co-operation and
the bringing together into one place of industries and
individuals mutually helpful; and it has become impossible
for us to believe that the <i>only</i> way to obtain
wealth is by depriving some one else of wealth they already
possess.</p>

Peasants' opinion of the school. Gymnastics. Reading.
The Bible. Penmanship. Grammar. History. Geography.

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> already mentioned, Tolstoy's magazine, besides its
theoretical articles, contained others describing the work
done at the Yásno-Polyána school, and from these we
learn in his own words, how Tolstoy and his pupils, and
the masters (including the young German, Keller, whom
he had brought back with him from abroad) were occupied
in November and December 1861. The following
passages are part of his description of the school:</p>

<p class="i2">No one brings anything with him, neither books nor copy-books.
No homework is set them. Not only do they carry
nothing in their hands, they have nothing to carry even in
their heads. They are not obliged to remember any lesson,
nor any of yesterday's work. They are not tormented by the
thought of the impending lesson. They bring only themselves,
their receptive nature, and an assurance that it will be as jolly
in school to-day as it was yesterday. They do not think of
their classes till they have begun. No one is ever scolded for
being late, and they never are late, except perhaps some of the
older boys whose fathers occasionally keep them at home to do
some work. In such cases the boy comes to school running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
fast and panting. Until the teacher arrives, some gather at
the porch, pushing one another off the steps or sliding on the
ice-covered path, and some go into the rooms. When it is
cold, while waiting for the master, they read, write, or play
about. The girls do not mix with the boys. When the boys
take any notice of the girls, they never address any one of them
in particular, but always speak to them collectively: 'Hey,
girls, why don't you come and slide?' or, 'Look how frozen
the girls are,' or, 'Now girls, all of you against me!'</p>

<p class="i2">Suppose that by the time-table the lesson for the youngest
class is elementary reading; for the second, advanced reading;
and for the third, mathematics. The teacher enters the room,
on the floor of which the boys are lying in a heap, shouting, 'The
heap is too small!' or, 'Boys, you're choking me!' or, 'Don't
pull my hair!' etc.</p>

<p class="i2">'Peter Miháylovitch!' cries a voice from the bottom of the
heap, to the teacher as he enters: 'Tell them to stop!'&mdash;'Good
morning, Peter Miháylovitch!' cry others, continuing
their scrimmage. The teacher takes the books and gives them
to those who have followed him to the cupboard, while from
the heap of boys on the floor, those on top, still sprawling,
demand books. The heap gradually diminishes. As soon as
most of the boys have taken books, the rest run to the cupboard
crying, 'Me too! Me too!'&mdash;'Give me yesterday's
book!'&mdash;'Give me Kóltsof!' and so forth. If a couple of boys
excited by their struggle still remain on the floor, those who
have taken books and settled down, shout at them, 'What are
you up to? We can't hear anything! Stop it!' The excited
ones submit, and, panting, take to their books; and only just
at first swing their legs with unspent excitement as they sit
reading. The spirit of war flies away and the spirit of reading
reigns in the room. With the same ardour with which he
pulled Mítka's hair, he now reads Kóltsof's works: with
almost clenched teeth, with sparkling eyes, and oblivious of all
around him but his book. To tear him from his reading now
would need as much effort as formerly to tear him from his
wrestling.</p>

<p class="i2">They sit where they like: on the benches, tables, window-sills,
floor, or in the arm-chair. The girls always sit together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Friends from the same village, especially the little ones (among
whom there is most comradeship) always sit together. As soon
as one of them decides that he will sit in a certain corner, all
his chums, pushing and diving under the forms, get there too,
and sit together looking about them with faces that express
as much happiness and satisfaction as though, having settled in
that place, they would certainly be happy for the rest of their
lives. The large arm-chair (which somehow found its way into
the room) is an object coveted by the more independent personalities....
As soon as one of them decides to sit in it,
another discerns his intention from his looks, and they collide
and squeeze in. One dislodges the other, and curling up,
sprawls with his head far below the back, but reads like the
rest, quite absorbed in his work. During lessons I have never
seen them whispering, pinching, giggling, laughing behind
their hands, or complaining of one another to the teacher.</p>

<p class="i2">The two lower classes sort themselves in one room, the upper
class in another. The teacher appears, and in the first class all
surround him at the blackboard, or lie on the forms, or sit on
the table, near him or near one of the boys who reads. If it is
a writing lesson, they place themselves in a more orderly way,
but keep getting up to look at one another's exercise books,
and to show their own to the teacher. According to the time-table
there should be four lessons before dinner; but sometimes
in practice these become three or two, and may be on quite
other subjects. The teacher may begin with arithmetic and pass
on to geometry; or may begin with Sacred History and end up
with grammar. Sometimes teacher and pupils are so carried
away, that a lesson lasts three hours instead of one. Sometimes
the pupils themselves cry: 'Go on, go on!' and shout contemptuously
to any who are tired: 'If you're tired, go to the
little ones!'</p>

<p class="i2">In my opinion this external disorder is useful and necessary,
however strange and inconvenient it may seem to the teacher.
Of its advantages I shall have frequent occasion to speak; but
of its apparent disadvantages I will say:</p>

<p class="i2">First, this disorder, or free order, only frightens us because
we ourselves were educated in, and are accustomed to, something
quite different. Secondly, in this as in many similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
cases, coercion is used only from hastiness or from lack of
respect for human nature. We think the disorder is growing
greater and greater, and that it has no limit. We think there
is no way of stopping it except by force; but one need only
wait a little, and the disorder (or animation) calms down of
itself, and calms down into a far better and more durable order
than any we could devise.</p>

<p>In another place he says:</p>

<p class="i2">Our school evolved freely from the principles brought into
it by the teachers and pupils. In spite of the predominant
influence of the teacher, the pupil always had the right not to
go to school; and even when in school, not to listen to the
teacher. The teacher had the right not to admit a pupil....</p>

<p class="i2">Submitting naturally only to laws derived from their own
nature, children revolt and rebel when subjected to your premature
interference. They do not believe in the validity of
your bells and time-tables and rules. How often have I seen
children fighting. The teacher rushes to separate them, and the
separated enemies look at one another askance, and even in the
stern teacher's presence cannot refrain from giving one another
a parting blow, yet more painful than its predecessors. How
often, any day, do I see some Kirúshka, clenching his teeth, fly
at Taráska, seize his hair, and throw him to the ground,
apparently&mdash;though it costs him his life&mdash;determined to maim his
foe; yet not a minute passes before Taráska is already laughing
under Kirúshka. One, and then the other, moderates his
blows, and before five minutes have passed they have made
friends, and off they go to sit together.</p>

<p class="i2">The other day, between lessons, two boys were struggling in
a corner. The one, a remarkable mathematician about ten
years old, is in the second class; the other, a close-cropped lad,
the son of a servant, is a clever but vindictive, tiny, black-eyed
lad, nicknamed Pussy. Pussy seized the mathematician's long
hair and jammed his head against the wall; the mathematician
vainly clutched at Pussy's close-cropped bristles. Pussy's black
eyes gleamed triumphantly. The mathematician, hardly refraining
from tears, kept saying: 'Well, well, what of it?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
But though he tried to keep up appearances, it was plain he
was faring badly. This went on for some time, and I was in
doubt what to do. 'A fight, a fight!' shouted the boys, and
crowded towards the corner. The little ones laughed; but
the bigger ones, though they did not interfere, exchanged
serious glances, and their silence and these glances did not
escape Pussy's observation. He understood that he was doing
something wrong, and began to smile shamefacedly, and by
degrees let go of the mathematician's hair. The mathematician
shook himself free, and giving Pussy a push that
banged the back of the latter's head against the wall, went off
satisfied. Pussy began to cry, and rushed after his enemy,
hitting him as hard as he could on his sheepskin coat, but
without hurting him. The mathematician wished to pay him
back, but at that moment several disapproving voices were
raised. 'There now; he's fighting a little fellow!' cried the
onlookers, 'get away, Pussy!'&mdash;and therewith the affair ended
as though it had never occurred, except, I think, that both
combatants retained a dim consciousness that fighting is unpleasant,
because both get hurt.</p>

<p class="i2">In this case I seemed to detect a feeling of fairness influencing
the crowd; but how often such affairs are settled so that
one does not know what law has decided them, and yet both
sides are satisfied! How arbitrary and unjust by comparison
are all School methods of dealing with such cases. 'You are
both to blame: kneel down!' says the teacher; and the
teacher is wrong, because one boy is in the wrong, and that one
triumphs while on his knees, and chews the cud of his unexpended
anger, while the innocent one is doubly punished....</p>

<p class="i2">I am convinced that the School should not interfere with
that part of education which belongs to the family. The
School should not, and has no right to, reward or punish; and
the best police and administration of a School consist in giving
full freedom to the pupils to learn and get on among themselves
as they like. I am convinced of this; and yet the customary
School habits are still so strong in us that in the Yásno-Polyána
school we frequently break this rule....</p>

<p class="i2">During last summer, while the school-house was being
repaired, a Leyden jar disappeared from the physical cabinet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
pencils disappeared repeatedly, as well as books&mdash;and this at
a time when neither the carpenters nor the painters were
at work. We questioned the boys. The best pupils, those
who had been with us longest, old friends of ours, blushed and
were so uneasy that any Public Prosecutor would have thought
their confusion a sure proof of their guilt. But I knew them,
and could answer for them as for myself. I understood that
the very idea of being suspected offended them deeply and
painfully. A gifted and tender-hearted boy, whom I will call
Theodore, turned quite pale, trembled and wept. They promised
to tell me, if they found out; but they declined to
undertake a search. A few days later the thief was discovered.
He was the son of a servant from a distant village. He had
led astray, and made an accomplice of, a peasant boy from the
same village; and together they had hidden the stolen articles
in a box. This discovery produced a strange feeling in the
other pupils: a kind of relief and even joy, accompanied by
contempt and pity for the thief. We proposed that they should
allot the punishment themselves. Some demanded that the
thief should be flogged, but stipulated that they should do the
flogging; others said: 'Sew a card on him, with the word
<i>thief</i>.' This latter punishment, to our shame be it said, had
been used by us before, and it was the very boy who a year ago
had himself been labelled <i>liar</i>, who now most insistently
demanded a card for the thief. We consented, and when one
of the girls was sewing the card on, all the pupils watched and
teased the punished boys with malicious joy. They wanted the
punishment increased: 'Let them be led through the village;
and let them wear cards till the holidays,' said they. The
victims cried. The peasant boy who had been led astray by his
comrade, a gifted narrator and jester, a plump, white, chubby
little chap, wept without restraint and with all his childish
might. The other, the chief offender, a hump-nosed boy with
a thin-featured, clever face, became pale, his lips quivered, his
eyes looked wildly and angrily at his joyous comrades, and
occasionally his face was unnaturally distorted by a sob. His
cap, with a torn peak, was stuck on the very back of his head;
his hair was ruffled, his clothes soiled with chalk. All this now
struck me and everybody else as though we saw it for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
time. The unkindly attention of all was directed to him, and
he felt it painfully. When, with bent head and without looking
round, he started homeward with (as it seemed to me) a
peculiar, criminal gait, and when the boys ran after him in
a crowd, teasing him in an unnatural and strangely cruel
way as though, against their will, they were moved by some
evil spirit, something told me that we were not doing right.
But things took their course, and the thief wore the card that
whole day. From this time he began, as it seemed to me, to
learn worse, and one did not see him playing and talking with
his fellows out of class.</p>

<p class="i2">One day I came to a lesson, and the pupils informed me, with
a kind of horror, that the boy had again stolen. He had taken
twenty copecks (seven pence) in coppers from the teacher's room,
and had been caught hiding them under the stairs. We again
hung a card on him; and again the same revolting scene recommenced.
I began to admonish him, as all masters admonish;
and a big boy, fond of talking, who was present, also admonished
him&mdash;probably repeating words he had heard his
father, an innkeeper, use: 'You steal once, and you do it
again,' said he distinctly, glibly, and with dignity; 'it becomes
a habit, and leads to no good.' I began to get vexed. I
glanced at the face of the punished boy, which had become yet
paler, more suffering and harder than before; and somehow I
thought of convicts, and suddenly I felt so ashamed and
disgusted that I tore the stupid card off him, told him to go
where he liked, and became convinced&mdash;and convinced not by
reason, but by my whole nature&mdash;that I had no right to
torment that unfortunate boy, and that it was not in my power
to make of him what I and the innkeeper's son wanted to make
of him. I became convinced that there are secrets of the soul,
hidden from us, on which life may act, but which precepts and
punishments do not reach.</p>

<p>It may be said that any department of life could be
treated in this way: we have merely to invert an established
order founded on the experience of men, and a
topsy-turvy millennium is born. It may also be said that
in the foregoing pages Tolstoy appears as the evangelist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of an educational system founded on the free play of
youthful instincts which, speaking merely the language of
natural animal life, call for sympathetic discipline. But
in his <i>Confession</i> Tolstoy has treated his educational writings
with such scant respect that criticism is disarmed;
more especially as the actual working of his school was
extremely interesting and much more successful than might
have been expected.</p>

<p>N. V. Ouspénsky, the writer, narrates that he visited
Yásnaya Polyána in 1862, and Tolstoy, having to leave
him alone for awhile, asked him to glance at some of the
compositions the boys had written in school. Taking up
one of these, Ouspénsky read:</p>

<p class="i2">One day, Lyóf Nikoláyevitch (Tolstoy) called Savóskin up to
the blackboard and ordered him to solve a problem in arithmetic.
'If I give you five rolls, and you eat one of them, how
many rolls will you have left?'... Savóskin could nohow solve
this problem, and the Count pulled his hair for it....</p>

<p>When Tolstoy returned Ouspénsky pointed out to him
this essay, and Tolstoy, sighing heavily, crossed his hands
before him and merely said: 'Life in this world is a hard
task.'</p>

<p>Ouspénsky considered that he had unearthed an extraordinary
contradiction between theory and practice; but
no one who realises the difficulty and novelty of Tolstoy's
attempt, and how far he is from claiming perfection for
himself or for his achievements, should agree with
Ouspénsky. On the contrary, the essay proves a freedom
of relation between teacher and pupil, which would
certainly not have existed had the hair-pulling been other
than impulsive and exceptional.</p>

<p>The school was closed, or nearly so, during the summer,
as most of the pupils then helped their parents with field
work; obtaining, Tolstoy considers, more mental development
that way than they could have done in any school. To make
up for this, the hours of study in winter were long.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
The classes generally finish about eight or nine o'clock
(unless carpentering keeps the elder boys somewhat later), and
the whole band run shouting into the yard, and there, calling
to one another, begin to separate, making for different parts of
the village. Occasionally they arrange to coast down-hill to
the village in a large sledge that stands outside the gate. They
tie up the shafts, throw themselves into it, and squealing, disappear
from sight in a cloud of snow, leaving here and there on
their path black patches of children who have tumbled out. In
the open air, out of school (for all its freedom) new relations
are formed between pupil and teacher: freer, simpler and more
trustful&mdash;those very relations which seem to us the ideal which
School should aim at.</p>

<p class="i2">Not long ago we read Gógol's story <i>Viy</i> [an Earth-Spirit] in
the highest class. The final scenes affected them strongly, and
excited their imagination. Some of them played the witch,
and kept alluding to the last chapters....</p>

<p class="i2">Out of doors it was a moonless, winter night, with clouds in
the sky, not cold. We stopped at the crossroads. The elder
boys, in their third year, stopped near me, asking me to accompany
them further. The younger ones looked at us, and
rushed off down-hill. They had begun to learn with a new
master, and between them and me there is not the same confidence
as between the older boys and myself.</p>

<p class="i2">'Well, let us go to the wood' (a small wood about 120 yards
from the house), said one of them. The most insistent was
Fédka, a boy of ten, with a tender, receptive, poetic yet daring
nature. Danger seems to form the chief condition of pleasure
for him. In summer it always frightened me to see how he,
with two other boys, would swim out into the very middle of
the pond, which is nearly 120 yards wide, and would now and
then disappear in the hot reflection of the summer sun, and
swim under water; and how he would then turn on his back,
causing fountains of water to rise, and calling with his high-pitched
voice to his comrades on the bank to see what a fine
fellow he was.</p>

<p class="i2">He now knew there were wolves in the wood, and so he
wanted to go there. All agreed; and the four of us went to the
wood. Another boy, a lad of twelve, physically and morally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
strong, whom I will call Syómka, went on in front and kept
calling and 'ah-ou-ing' with his ringing voice, to some one at
a distance. Prónka, a sickly, mild and very gifted lad, from a
poor family (sickly probably chiefly from lack of food), walked
by my side. Fédka walked between me and Syómka, talking
all the time in a particularly gentle voice: now relating how
he had herded horses in summer, now saying there was nothing
to be afraid of, and now asking, 'Suppose one should jump
out?' and insisting on my giving some reply. We did not go
into the wood: that would have been too dreadful; but even
where we were, near the wood, it was darker, and the road was
scarcely visible, and the lights of the village were hidden from
view. Syómka stopped and listened: 'Stop, lads! What is
that?' said he suddenly.</p>

<p class="i2">We were silent, and though we heard nothing, things seemed
to grow more gruesome.</p>

<p class="i2">'What shall we do if it leaps out ... and comes at us?'
asked Fédka.</p>

<p class="i2">We began to talk about Caucasian robbers. They remembered
a Caucasian tale I had told them long ago, and I again
told them of 'braves,' of Cossacks, and of Hádji Mourát.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Syómka went on in front, treading boldly in his big boots, his
broad back swaying regularly. Prónka tried to walk by my side,
but Fédka pushed him off the path, and Prónka&mdash;who, probably
on account of his poverty, always submitted&mdash;only ran up alongside
at the most interesting passages, sinking in the snow up to
his knees.</p>

<p class="i2">Every one who knows anything of Russian peasant children
knows that they are not accustomed to, and cannot bear, any
caresses, affectionate words, kisses, hand touchings, and so
forth. I have seen a lady in a peasant school, wishing to pet a
boy, say: 'Come, I will give you a kiss, dear!' and actually
kiss him; and the boy was ashamed and offended, and could
not understand why he had been so treated. Boys of five are
already above such caresses&mdash;they are no longer babies. I was
therefore particularly struck when Fédka, walking beside me,
at the most terrible part of the story suddenly touched me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
lightly with his sleeve, and then clasped two of my fingers in
his hand, and kept hold of them. As soon as I stopped speaking,
Fédka demanded that I should go on, and did this in
such a beseeching and agitated voice that it was impossible not
to comply with his wish.</p>

<p class="i2">'Now then, don't get in the way!' said he once angrily to
Prónka, who had run in front of us. He was so carried away
as even to be cruel; so agitated yet happy was he, holding on
to my fingers, that he could let no one dare to interrupt his
pleasure.</p>

<p class="i2">'Some more! Some more! It is fine!' said he.</p>

<p class="i2">We had passed the wood and were approaching the village
from the other end.</p>

<p class="i2">'Let's go on,' said all the boys when the lights became
visible. 'Let us take another turn!'</p>

<p class="i2">We went on in silence, sinking here and there in the rotten
snow, not hardened by much traffic. A white darkness seemed
to sway before our eyes; the clouds hung low, as though something
had heaped them upon us. There was no end to that
whiteness, amid which we alone crunched along the snow.
The wind sounded through the bare tops of the aspens, but
where we were, behind the woods, it was calm.</p>

<p class="i2">I finished my story by telling how a 'brave,' surrounded by
his enemies, sang his death-song and threw himself on his
dagger. All were silent.</p>

<p class="i2">'Why did he sing a song when he was surrounded?' asked
Syómka.</p>

<p class="i2">'Weren't you told?&mdash;He was preparing for death!' replied
Fédka, aggrieved.</p>

<p class="i2">'I think he sang a prayer,' added Prónka.</p>

<p class="i2">All agreed. Fédka suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class="i2">'How was it, you told us, your Aunt had her throat cut?'
asked he. (He had not yet had enough horrors.) 'Tell us!
Tell us!'</p>

<p class="i2">I again told them that terrible story of the murder of the
Countess Tolstoy,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and they stood silently about me, watching
my face.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
'The fellow got caught!' said Syómka.</p>

<p class="i2">'He was afraid to go away in the night, while she was lying
with her throat cut!' said Fédka; 'I should have run away!'
and he gathered my two fingers yet more closely in his hand.</p>

<p class="i2">We stopped in the thicket, beyond the threshing-floor at the
very end of the village. Syómka picked up a dry stick from
the snow and began striking it against the frosty trunk of a lime
tree. Hoar frost fell from the branches on to one's cap, and
the noise of the blows resounded in the stillness of the wood.</p>

<p class="i2">'Lyóf Nikoláyevitch,' said Fédka to me (I thought he was
going again to speak about the Countess), 'why does one learn
singing? I often think, why, really, does one?'</p>

<p class="i2">What made him jump from the terror of the murder to this
question, heaven only knows; yet by the tone of his voice,
the seriousness with which he demanded an answer, and the
attentive silence of the other two, one felt that there was some
vital and legitimate connection between this question and our
preceding talk. Whether the connection lay in some response
to my suggestion that crime might be explained by lack of
education (I had spoken of that) or whether he was testing
himself&mdash;transferring himself into the mind of the murderer and
remembering his own favourite occupation (he has a wonderful
voice and immense musical talent) or whether the connection
lay in the fact that he felt that now was the time for
sincere conversation, and all the problems demanding solution
rose in his mind&mdash;at any rate his question surprised none of us.</p>

<p class="i2">'And what is drawing for? And why write well?' said I,
not knowing at all how to explain to him what art is for.</p>

<p class="i2">'What is drawing for?' repeated he thoughtfully. He really
was asking, What is Art for? And I neither dared nor could
explain.</p>

<p class="i2">'What is drawing for?' said Syómka. 'Why, you draw anything,
and can then make it from the drawing.'</p>

<p class="i2">'No, that is designing,' said Fédka. 'But why draw figures?'</p>

<p class="i2">Syómka's matter-of-fact mind was not perplexed.</p>

<p class="i2">'What is a stick for, and what is a lime tree for?' said he,
still striking the tree.</p>

<p class="i2">'Yes, what is a lime tree for?' said I.</p>

<p class="i2">'To make rafters of,' replied Syómka.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
'But what is it for in summer, when not yet cut down?'</p>

<p class="i2">'Then, it's no use.'</p>

<p class="i2">'No, really,' insisted Fédka; 'why does a lime tree grow?'</p>

<p class="i2">And we began to speak of the fact that not everything exists
for use, but that there is also beauty, and that Art is beauty;
and we understood one another, and Fédka quite understood
why the lime tree grows and what singing is for.</p>

<p class="i2">Prónka agreed with us, but he thought rather of moral
beauty: goodness.</p>

<p class="i2">Syómka understood with his big brain, but did not acknowledge
beauty apart from usefulness. He was in doubt (as often
happens to men with great reasoning power): feeling Art to
be a force, but not feeling in his soul the need of that force.
He, like them, wished to get at Art by his reason, and tried to
kindle that fire in himself.</p>

<p class="i2">'We'll sing <i>Who hath</i> to-morrow. I remember my part,' said
he. (He has a correct ear, but no taste or refinement in singing.)
Fédka, however, fully understood that the lime tree is good when
in leaf: good to look at in summer; and that that is enough.</p>

<p class="i2">Prónka understood that it is a pity to cut it down, because
it, too, has life:</p>

<p class="i2">'Why, when we take the sap of a lime, it's like taking blood.'</p>

<p class="i2">Syómka, though he did not say so, evidently thought that
there was little use in a lime when it was sappy.</p>

<p class="i2">It feels strange to repeat what we then said, but it seems to
me that we said all that can be said about utility, and plastic
and moral beauty.</p>

<p class="i2">We went on to the village. Fédka still clung to my hand;
now, it seemed to me, from gratitude. We all were nearer one
another that night than we had been for a long time. Prónka
walked beside us along the broad village street.</p>

<p class="i2">'See, there is still a light in Mazánof's house,' said he. 'As
I was going to school this morning, Gavrúka was coming from
the pub, as dru-u-nk as could be! His horse all in a lather
and he beating it! I am always sorry for such things. Really,
why should it be beaten?'</p>

<p class="i2">'And the other day, coming from Toúla, my daddy gave his
horse the reins,' said Syómka; 'and it took him into a snow-drift
and there he slept&mdash;quite drunk.'</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
'And Gavrúka kept on beating his horse over the eyes, and I
felt so sorry,' repeated Prónka again. 'Why should he beat it?
He got down and just flogged it.'</p>

<p class="i2">Syómka suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class="i2">'Our folk are already asleep,' said he, looking in at the
window of his crooked, dirty hut. 'Won't you walk a little
longer?'</p>

<p class="i2">'No.'</p>

<p class="i2">'Go-o-od-bye, Lyóf Nikoláyevitch!' shouted he suddenly, and
tearing himself away from us, as it were with an effort, he ran
to the house, lifted the latch and disappeared.</p>

<p class="i2">'So you will take each of us home? First one and then the
other?' said Fédka.</p>

<p class="i2">We went on. There was a light in Prónka's hut, and we
looked in at the window. His mother, a tall and handsome
but toil-worn woman, with black eyebrows and eyes, sat at the
table, peeling potatoes. In the middle of the hut hung a
cradle. Prónka's brother, the mathematician from our second
class, was standing at the table, eating potatoes with salt. It
was a black, tiny, and dirty hut.</p>

<p class="i2">'What a plague you are!' shouted the mother at Prónka.
'Where have you been?'</p>

<p class="i2">Prónka glanced at the window with a meek, sickly smile.
His mother guessed that he had not come alone, and her face
immediately assumed a feigned expression that was not nice.</p>

<p class="i2">Only Fédka was left.</p>

<p class="i2">'The travelling tailors are at our house, that is why there's
a light there,' said he in the softened voice that had come to
him that evening. 'Good-bye, Lyóf Nikoláyevitch!' added he,
softly and tenderly, and he began to knock with the ring
attached to the closed door. 'Let me in!' his high-pitched
voice rang out amid the winter stillness of the village. It was
long before they opened the door for him. I looked in at the
window. The hut was a large one. The father was playing
cards with a tailor, and some copper coins lay on the table.
The wife, Fédka's stepmother, was sitting near the torch-stand,
looking eagerly at the money. The young tailor, a cunning
drunkard, was holding his cards on the table, bending them,
and looking triumphantly at his opponent. Fédka's father, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
collar of his shirt unbuttoned, his brow wrinkled with mental
exertion and vexation, changed one card for another, and
waved his horny hand in perplexity above them.</p>

<p class="i2">'Let me in!'</p>

<p class="i2">The woman rose and went to the door.</p>

<p class="i2">'Good-bye!' repeated Fédka, once again. 'Let us always
have such walks!'</p>

<p>Thus Tolstoy for the second time found himself faced
by the question: What is Art? which had arisen when he
spoke to the Society of Lovers of Russian Literature.
This time it was put to him by a ten-year-old peasant
boy, and it seemed to him that: 'We said all that can be
said about utility, and plastic and moral beauty.' Twenty
years later, after achieving the highest fame as a literary
artist, he returned to the subject and tried to write an
essay on the connection between life and Art, thinking
that he would be able to accomplish it at a single effort.
It proved, however, as he tells us, 'that my views on the
matter were so far from clear, that I could not arrange
them in a way that satisfied me. From that time I did
not cease to think of the subject, and I recommenced
writing on it six or seven times; but each time, after
writing a considerable part of it, I found myself unable to
bring the work to a satisfactory conclusion, and had to
put it aside.' Only after another fifteen years' study and
reflection did he succeed, in 1898, in producing <i>What is
Art?</i> which raised such a storm in the esthetic dovecots,
and induced the editor of <i>Literature</i> to declare that 'There
was never any reason for inferring that Count Tolstoy's
opinions on the philosophy of art would be worth the
paper on which they were written'; while A. B. Walkley
was asserting that 'this calmly and cogently reasoned
effort to put art on a new basis is a literary event of the
first importance.'</p>

<p>We have, however, as yet only reached the year 1862,
and must not anticipate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the peasants were rather afraid of the school,
but before long they gained confidence and the report
became current among them that: 'At Yásno-Polyána
school they learn everything, including all the sciences,
and there are such clever masters that it is dreadful; it is
said that they even imitate thunder and lightning. Anyway,
the lads understand well, and have begun to read and
write.' Another very general opinion was that: 'They
teach the boys everything (like gentlemen's sons) much of
it is no use, but still, as they quickly learn to read, it is
worth sending the children there.'</p>

<p>Naturally Tolstoy, himself in those days an ardent
gymnast, had parallel and horizontal bars put up, and
gave the children physical training. To the effects of
this on the stomach, the village mothers did not fail to
attribute any digestive troubles that befell their children
from time to time; especially when the long Lenten fast
was succeeded by a return to more appetising food, or
when, after such luxuries had long been lacking, fresh
vegetables again came into use in summer.</p>

<p>In his account of the Yásno-Polyána school, Tolstoy
tells us there were about forty pupils enrolled, but more
than thirty were rarely present at a time; among them
were four or five girls, and sometimes three or four male
adults who came either for a month or for a whole winter.
Most of the boys were from seven to ten years old.
(Tolstoy says that children learn to read most rapidly,
easily and well, between the ages of six and eight.)</p>

<p>There were four teachers, and generally from five to
seven lessons a day. The teachers kept diaries of their
work, and discussed matters together on Sundays, when
they drew up plans for the coming week. These plans
were, however, not strictly adhered to, but were constantly
modified to meet the demands of the pupils.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's sister told me of another Sunday occupation at
Yásnaya Polyána in those days. Tolstoy used to invite all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the boys from the neighbouring schools within reach, and
used to play games with them; the favourite game being
<i>Barre</i>, which I assume to be a form of 'Storm the Castle.'</p>

<p>Tolstoy came to the conclusion that teachers involuntarily
strive to find a method of teaching convenient for themselves,
and that the more convenient a method is for the
teacher, the less convenient it is for the pupil; and only
<i>that</i> method is good which satisfies the pupils.</p>

<p>His theory of freedom as the basis of success in instruction,
was put to a rude test by the fact that for a considerable
time his pupils made little or no headway in learning
to read. He says:</p>

<p class="i2">The simple thought that the time had not yet come for good
reading and that there was at present no need of it, but that
the pupils would themselves find the best method when the
need arose, only recently entered my head.</p>

<p>After telling how the boys first met the difficulty of
mastering the mechanical process of reading, Tolstoy goes
on to tell how in the upper class progress was suddenly
made owing to what seemed an accident.</p>

<p class="i2">In the class of advanced reading some one book is used, each
boy reading in turn, and then all telling its contents together.
They had been joined that autumn by an extremely talented
lad, T., who had studied for two years with a sacristan, and was
therefore ahead of them all in reading. He reads as we do,
and so the pupils only understand anything of the advanced
reading (and then not very much of it) when he reads; and yet
each of them wishes to read. But as soon as a bad reader
begins, the others express dissatisfaction, especially when the
story is interesting. They laugh, and get cross, and the bad
reader feels ashamed, and endless disputes arise. Last month
one of the boys announced that at any cost he would manage,
within a week, to read as well as T.; others made the same
announcement, and suddenly mechanical reading became their
favourite occupation. For an hour or an hour-and-a-half at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
time, they would sit without tearing themselves away from the
books, which they did not understand; and they began taking
books home with them; and really, within three weeks, they
made such progress as could not have been expected.</p>

<p class="i2">In their case the reverse had happened of what usually
occurs with those who learn the rudiments. Generally a man
learns to read, and finds nothing he cares to read or understand.
In this case the pupils were convinced that there is something
worth reading and understanding, but felt that they lacked
the capacity; and so they set to work to become proficient
readers.</p>

<p>A difficulty of enormous importance was the absence of
books really suitable for simple folk to read.</p>

<p class="i2">The insoluble problem was that for the education of the
people an ability and a desire to read good books is essential.
Good books are, however, written in a literary language the
people don't understand. In order to learn to understand it,
one would have to read a great deal; and people won't read
willingly unless they understand what they read.</p>

<p>Connected with this difficulty of finding books suited to
the understanding of peasants and of peasant children, was
the parallel difficulty of finding literary subjects that interested
them. This was first met by reading the Old
Testament stories to them:</p>

<p class="i2">A knowledge of Sacred History was demanded both by the
pupils themselves and by their parents. Of all the oral subjects
I tried during three years, nothing so suited the understanding
and mental condition of the boys as the Old Testament.
The same was the case in all the schools that came under my
observation. I tried the New Testament, I tried Russian History
and Geography, I tried explanations of natural phenomena (so
much advocated to-day), but it was all listened to unwillingly
and quickly forgotten. But the Old Testament was remembered
and narrated eagerly both in class and at home, and so
well remembered that after two months the children wrote
Scripture tales from memory with very slight omissions.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
It seems to me that the book of the childhood of the race
will always be the best book for the childhood of each man.
It seems to me impossible to replace that book. To alter or
to abbreviate the Bible, as is done in Sonntag's and other
school primers, appears to me bad. All&mdash;every word&mdash;in it is
right, both as revelation and as art. Read about the creation
of the world in the Bible, and then read it in an abbreviated
Sacred History, and the alteration of the Bible into the Sacred
History will appear to you quite unintelligible. The latter
can only be learnt by heart; while the Bible presents the
child with a vivid and majestic picture he will never forget.
The omissions made in the Sacred History are quite unintelligible,
and only impair the character and beauty of the
Scriptures. Why, for instance, is the statement omitted in all
the Sacred Histories, that when there was nothing, the Spirit of
God moved upon the face of the waters, and that after having
created, God looked at His creation and saw that it was good,
and that then it was the morning and evening of such and
such a day? Why do they omit that God breathed into
Adam's nostrils the breath of life, and that having taken one of
his ribs He with the flesh closed up the place thereof, and
so forth? One must read the Bible to unperverted children,
to understand how necessary and true it all is. Perhaps one
ought not to give the Bible to perverted young ladies; but
when reading it to peasant children I did not alter or omit a
single word. None of them giggled behind another's back;
but all listened eagerly and with natural reverence. The story
of Lot and his daughters, and the story of Judah's son, evoked
horror but not laughter....</p>

<p class="i2">How intelligible and clear it all is, especially for a child, and
yet how stern and serious! I cannot imagine what instruction
would be possible, without that book. Yet when one has
learnt these stories only in childhood, and has afterwards partly
forgotten them, one thinks: What good do they do us? Would
it not be all the same if one did not know them at all? So it
seems till, on beginning to teach, you test on other children
the elements that helped to develop you. It seems as if one
could teach children to write and read and calculate, and
could give them an idea of history, geography, and natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
phenomena, without the Bible, and before the Bible; yet
nowhere is this done: everywhere the child first of all gets
to know the Bible, its stories, or extracts from it. The first
relations of the learner to the teacher are founded on that
book. Such a general fact is not an accident. My very free
relations with my pupils at the commencement of the Yásno-Polyána
school helped me to find the explanation of this
phenomenon.</p>

<p class="i2">A child or a man on entering school (I make no distinction
between a ten-, thirty-, or seventy-year-old man) brings with
him the special view of things he has deduced from life and to
which he is attached. In order that a man of any age should
begin to learn, it is necessary that he should love learning.
That he should love learning, he must recognise the falseness
and insufficiency of his own view of things, and must scent afar
off that new view of life which learning is to reveal to him.
No man or boy would have the strength to learn, if the result
of learning presented itself to him merely as a capacity to
write, to read, and to reckon. No master could teach if he did
not command an outlook on life higher than his pupils possess.
That a pupil may surrender himself whole-heartedly to his
teacher, one corner must be lifted of the veil which hides from
him all the delight of that world of thought, knowledge, and
poetry to which learning will admit him. Only by being
constantly under the spell of that bright light shining ahead
of him, will the pupil be able to use his powers in the way we
require of him.</p>

<p class="i2">What means have we of lifting this corner of the veil?...
As I have said, I thought as many think, that being myself in
the world to which I had to introduce my pupils, it would be
easy for me to do this; and I taught the rudiments, explained
natural phenomena, and told them, as the primers do, that the
fruits of learning are sweet; but the scholars did not believe
me, and kept aloof. Then I tried reading the Bible to
them, and quite took possession of them. The corner of the
veil was lifted, and they yielded themselves to me completely.
They fell in love with the book, and with learning, and with
me. It only remained for me to guide them on....</p>

<p class="i2">To reveal to the pupil a new world, and to make him, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>out
possessing knowledge, love knowledge, there is no book but
the Bible. I speak even for those who do not regard the Bible
as a revelation. There are no other works&mdash;at least I know
none&mdash;which in so compressed and poetic a form contain all
those sides of human thought which the Bible unites in itself.
All the questions raised by natural phenomena are there dealt
with. Of all the primitive relations of men with one another:
the family, the State, and religion, we first become conscious
through that book. The generalisations of thought and wisdom,
with the charm given by their childlike simplicity of form,
seize the pupil's mind for the first time. Not only does the
lyricism of David's psalms act on the minds of the elder pupils;
but more than that, from this book every one becomes conscious
for the first time of the whole beauty of the epos in its
incomparable simplicity and strength. Who has not wept over
the story of Joseph and his meeting with his brethren? Who
has not, with bated breath, told the story of the bound and
shorn Samson, revenging himself on his enemies and perishing
under the ruins of the palace he destroys, or received a hundred
other impressions on which we were reared as on our
mothers' milk?</p>

<p class="i2">Let those who deny the educative value of the Bible and say
it is out of date, invent a book and stories explaining the
phenomena of Nature, either from general history or from the
imagination, which will be accepted as the Bible stories are;
and then we will admit that the Bible is obsolete....</p>

<p class="i2">Drawn though it may be from a one-sided experience, I
repeat my conviction. The development of a child or a man
in our society without the Bible, is as inconceivable as that of
an ancient Greek would have been without Homer. The Bible
is the only book to begin with, for a child's reading. The
Bible, both in its form and in its contents, should serve as
a model for all children's primers and all reading books. A
translation of the Bible into the language of the common folk,
would be the best book for the people.</p>

<p>When pupils came from other schools where they had
had to learn Scripture by heart, or had been inoculated
with the abbreviated school-primer versions, Tolstoy found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that the Bible had nothing like as strong an effect as
it had on boys who came fresh to it.</p>

<p class="i2">Such pupils do not experience what is felt by fresh pupils,
who listen to the Bible with beating heart, seizing every word,
thinking that now, now at last, all the wisdom of the world is
about to be revealed to them.</p>

<p>In reading the above passages, it should be borne in
mind that in Russian usage 'The Bible' means the Old
Testament only.</p>

<p>Besides the Bible, the only books the people understand
and like, says Tolstoy, are those written not for the people
but by the people; such as folk-tales and collections of
songs, legends, proverbs, verses, and riddles. There was
much in his experience which fits in with what Mr. Cecil
Sharp and Miss Neal of the Espérance Club, have lately
been demonstrating by their revivals of English Folk Songs
and Dances: namely, that there is an excellent literature
and art which children and common folk appreciate and
assimilate as eagerly and excellently as any one, and which
it is the height of folly for cultured people to despise;
and his keen perception of the gap that separates the art
and literature accessible to the people from the art that
by its artificiality is beyond their reach, led him subsequently
to undertake, first a series of school primers, and
then the re-telling of a number of folk-tales and legends,
which have reached more readers, and perhaps benefited
the world more, than anything else he has written.</p>

<p>With penmanship it happened at Yásno-Polyána school,
as with reading:</p>

<p class="i2">The pupils wrote very badly, and a new master introduced
writing from copies (another exercise very sedate and easy for
the master). The pupils became dull, and we were obliged to
abandon calligraphy, and did not know how to devise any way
of improving their handwriting. The eldest class discovered
the way for itself. Having finished writing the Bible stories,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the elder pupils began to ask for their exercise-books to take
home [probably to read to their parents]. These were dirty,
crumpled, and badly written. The precise mathematician P.
asked for some paper, and set to work to rewrite his stories.
This idea pleased the others. 'Give me, too, some paper!'&mdash;
'Give me an exercise-book!' and a fashion for calligraphy set
in, which still prevails in the upper class. They took an
exercise-book, put before them a written alphabet copy from
which they imitated each letter, boasting to one another of
their performance, and in two weeks' time they had made
great progress.</p>

<p>Grammar turned out to be an unsatisfactory subject,
and to have hardly any connection with correct writing
or speaking.</p>

<p class="i2">In our youngest&mdash;the third&mdash;class, they write what they
like. Besides that, the youngest write out in the evening,
one at a time, sentences they have composed all together.
One writes, and the others whisper among themselves, noting
his mistakes, and only waiting till he has finished, in order to
denounce his misplaced e or his wrongly detached prefix, or sometimes
to perpetrate a blunder of their own. To write correctly
and to correct mistakes made by others, gives them great
pleasure. The elder boys seize every letter they can get hold
of, exercising themselves in the correction of mistakes, and
trying with all their might to write correctly; but they cannot
bear grammar or the analysis of sentences, and in spite of a
bias we had for analysis, they only tolerate it to a very limited
extent, falling asleep or evading the classes.</p>

<p>History on the whole went badly, except such bits of
Russian history as, when told poetically, aroused patriotic
feelings. On one memorable occasion the whole class went
wild with excitement and eager interest. That was when
Tolstoy, with a poet's licence, told of the defeat of
Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812.</p>

<p>Except in this legendary way, the teaching of history to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
children is, in Tolstoy's opinion, useless. The historic
sense develops later than the artistic sense:</p>

<p class="i2">In my experience and practice the first germ of interest in
history arises out of contemporary events, sometimes as a result
of participation in them, through political interest, political
opinions, debates, and the reading of newspapers. Consequently
the idea of beginning the teaching of history from
present times should suggest itself to every intelligent teacher.</p>

<p>Of geography as a subject for the education of children,
Tolstoy has an even lower opinion:</p>

<p class="i2">In Von Vizin's comedy <i>The Minor</i>, when Mitrofánoushka was
being persuaded to learn geography, his mother said: 'Why
teach him all the countries? The coachman will drive him
where he may have to go to.' Nothing more to the point has
ever been said against geography, and all the learned men in
the world put together cannot rebut such an irrefragable
argument. I am speaking quite seriously. What need was
there for me to know where the river and town of Barcelona
are situated, when for thirty-three years I have not once had
occasion to use the knowledge? Not even the most picturesque
description of Barcelona and its inhabitants could, I imagine,
conduce to the development of my mental faculties.</p>

<p>In fact, the sweeping conclusion at which Tolstoy arrives
is that:</p>

<p class="i2">I not only see no use, but I see great harm, in teaching
history or geography before the University is reached.</p>

<p>And he leaves it an open question whether even the
University should concern itself with such subjects.</p>

<p>Drawing was a favourite lesson with the boys; but I
must confine myself to a single extract on that subject:</p>

<p class="i2">We drew figures from the blackboard in the following way:
I first drew a horizontal or a vertical line, dividing it into parts
by dots, and the pupils copied this line. Then I drew another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
or several perpendicular or sloping lines, standing in a certain
relation to the first, and similarly divided up. Then we joined
the dots of these different lines by others (straight or curved),
and formed some symmetrical figure which, as it was gradually
evolved, was copied by the boys. It seemed to me that this
was a good plan: first, because the boy clearly saw the whole
process of the formation of the figure, and secondly, because
his perception of the co-relation of lines was developed by this
drawing from the board, much better than by copying drawings
or designs....</p>

<p class="i2">It is nearly always useless to hang up a large complete
picture or figure, because a beginner is quite at a loss before
it, as he would be before an object from nature. But the
growth of the figure before his eyes has an important meaning.
In this case the pupil sees the backbone and skeleton of the
drawing on which the body is subsequently formed. The
pupils were always called on to criticise the lines and their
relation, as I drew them. I often purposely drew them wrong,
to find out in how far their judgment of the co-relation and
incorrectness of the lines had been developed. Then again,
when I was drawing my figure I asked the boys where they
thought the next line should be added; and I even made one
or other of them invent the shape of the figure himself.</p>

<p class="i2">In this way I not only aroused a more lively interest, but
got the boys to participate freely in the formation and development
of the figures; and this prevented the question. Why?
which boys so naturally put when they are set to draw from
copies.</p>

<p class="i2">The ease or difficulty with which it was understood, and the
more or less interest evoked, chiefly influenced the choice of
the method of instruction; and I often quite abandoned what
I had prepared for the lesson, merely because it was dull or
foreign to the boys.</p>

<p>In the singing class, Tolstoy very soon found that notes
written on the staff were not easily grasped by the pupils,
and after using the staff for some ten lessons, he once
showed the boys the use of numbers instead, and from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
day forward they always asked him to use numbers, and
they themselves always used numbers in writing music.
This method is much more convenient, Tolstoy considers,
for explaining both the intervals and the changes of key.
The pupils who were not musical soon dropped out of the
class, and the lessons with those who were, sometimes went
on for three or four hours at a stretch. He tried to teach
them musical time in the usual manner, but succeeded so
badly that he had to take that and melody separately.
First he took the sounds without reference to time, and then
beat the time without considering the sounds, and finally
joined the two processes together. After several lessons
he found that the method he had drifted into, combined the
chief features (though not some of the minor peculiarities)
of Chevet's method, which, as already mentioned, he had
seen in successful operation in Paris. After a very few
lessons, two of the boys used to write down the melodies of
the songs they knew, and were almost able to read music
at sight.</p>

<p>From the limited experience he had in teaching music,
Tolstoy&mdash;to quote his own words almost textually&mdash;became
convinced that: (1) To write sounds by means of figures
is the most profitable method; (2) To teach time separately
from sound is the most profitable method; (3) For the
teaching of music to be willingly and fruitfully received,
one must from the start teach the <i>art</i> and not aim merely
at dexterity in singing or playing. Spoilt young ladies
may be taught to play Burgmüller's exercises; but it is
better not to teach the children of the people at all, than
to teach them mechanically; (4) Nothing so harms musical
instruction as what looks like a knowledge of music:
namely the performance of choirs, and performances at
examinations, speech-days, or in church; and (5) In teaching
music to the people, the thing to be aimed at is to impart
our knowledge of the general laws of music, but not the
false taste we have developed among us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the most remarkable of his articles, Tolstoy
tells how he discovered that Fédka and Syómka possessed
literary ability of the highest order. Composition lessons
had not gone well, until one day Tolstoy proposed that the
children should write a story of peasant life to illustrate a
popular proverb. Most of them felt this to be beyond
their powers, and went on with their other occupations.
One of them, however, bade Tolstoy write it himself in
competition with them, and he set to work to do so, till
Fédka, climbing on the back of his chair, interrupted him
by reading over his shoulder. Tolstoy then began reading
out what he had composed, and explaining how he thought
of continuing the story. Several of the boys became interested,
not approving of Tolstoy's work, but criticising
and amending it, offering suggestions and supplying
details. Syómka and Fédka particularly distinguished
themselves, and showed extraordinary imagination, and
such judgment, sense of proportion, restraint, and power
of clothing their thoughts in words, that Tolstoy was
carried away by the interest of the work and wrote as
hard as he could to their dictation, having constantly to
ask them to wait and not forget the details they had
suggested. Fédka&mdash;of whom Tolstoy says that 'The chief
quality in every art, the sense of proportion, was in him
extraordinarily developed: he writhed at every superfluous
detail suggested by any of the other boys,'&mdash;gradually took
control of the work, and ruled so despotically and with
such evident right, that the others dropped off and went
home, except Syómka, who along his own more matter-of-fact
line continued to co-operate.</p>

<p class="i2">We worked from seven in the evening till eleven. They
felt neither hunger nor weariness and were even angry with
me when I stopped writing; and they set to work to do it
themselves turn and turn about, but did not get on well and
soon gave it up....</p>

<p class="i2">I left the lesson because I was too excited.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
'What is the matter with you? Why are you so pale: are
you ill?' asked my colleague. Indeed, only two or three times
in my life have I experienced such strong emotion as during
that evening....</p>

<p>Next day Tolstoy could hardly believe the experience of
the night before. It seemed incredible that a peasant boy,
hardly able to read, should suddenly display such marvellous
command of artistic creative power.</p>

<p class="i2">It seemed to me strange and offensive that I, the author
of <i>Childhood</i>, who had achieved a certain success and was
recognised by the educated Russian public as possessing artistic
talent, should in artistic matters not merely be unable to
instruct or help eleven-year-old Syómka and Fédka, but should
hardly be able, except at a happy moment of excitement, to
keep up with them and understand them.</p>

<p class="i2">Next day we set to work to continue the story. When I
asked Fédka if he had thought of a continuation, he only
waved his hand and remarked: 'I know, I know!... Who
will do the writing?'... We resumed the work, and again
the boys showed the same enthusiasm, and the same sense of
artistic truth and proportion.</p>

<p class="i2">Half-way through the lesson I had to leave them. They
wrote two pages without me, as just in feeling and as true to
life as the preceding ones. These two pages were rather
poorer in detail, some of the details were not quite happily
placed, and there were also a couple of repetitions. All this
had evidently occurred because the actual writing was a
difficulty for them. On the third day we had similar success....
There could no longer be any doubt or thought of its
being a mere accident. We had obviously succeeded in finding
a more natural and inspiring method than any we had
previously tried.</p>

<p>This unfinished story was accidentally destroyed. Tolstoy
was greatly annoyed, and Fédka and Syómka, though they
did not understand his vexation, offered to stay the night
at his house and reproduce it. After eight o'clock, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
school was over, they came, and (to Tolstoy's great pleasure)
locked themselves into his study, where at first they were
heard laughing but then became very quiet. On listening
at the door Tolstoy heard their subdued voices discussing
the story, and heard also the scratching of a pen. At
midnight he knocked and was admitted. Syómka was
standing at the large table, writing busily; his lines
running crookedly across the paper and his pen constantly
seeking the inkstand. Fédka told Tolstoy to 'wait a bit,'
and insisted on Syómka's adding something more, to his
dictation. At last Tolstoy took the exercise-book; and
the lads, after enjoying a merry supper of potatoes and
<i>kvás</i>, divested themselves of their sheepskin coats and lay
down to sleep under the writing table; their 'charming,
healthy, childish, peasant laughter' still ringing through
the room.</p>

<p>The story just mentioned, and other stories written by
the children, were published in the magazine; and Tolstoy
declares them to be, in their way, superior to anything else
in Russian literature. It was largely on the model of
these peasant children's stories that, years later, he wrote
his own famous stories for the people.</p>

<p>The rules for encouraging composition which he deduces
from his experience are these:</p>

<p class="i2">(1) To offer as large and varied a choice of themes as possible;
not inventing them specially for the children, but
offering such as most interest the teacher and seem to him
most important.</p>

<p class="i2">(2) To give children stories written by children to read,
and to offer only children's compositions as models; because
these are juster, finer and more moral than those written by
adults.</p>

<p class="i2">(3) (Specially important.) Never, when looking through the
compositions, make any remarks to the children about the
neatness of the exercise-books, the handwriting, or the spelling;
nor, above all, about the construction of the sentences,
or about logic.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
(4) Since the difficulty of composition lies not in size nor in
subject, nor in correctness of language, but in the mechanism
of the work, which consists: (<i>a</i>) in choosing one out of the large
number of thoughts and images that offer themselves; (<i>b</i>) in
choosing words wherewith to clothe it; (<i>c</i>) in remembering it
and finding a fitting place for it; (<i>d</i>) in remembering what has
already been written, so as not to repeat anything or omit anything,
and in finding a way of joining up what has preceded
to what succeeds; (<i>e</i>) and finally in so managing that while
thinking and writing at one and the same time, the one operation
shall not hamper the other,&mdash;I, having these things in
view, proceeded as follows.</p>

<p class="i2">At first I took upon myself some of these sides of the work,
transferring them gradually to the pupils. At first, out of the
thoughts and images suggested, I chose for them those which
seemed to me best, and I kept these in mind and indicated
suitable places to insert them, and I looked over what had
been written to avoid repetitions, and I did the writing myself,
letting them merely clothe the thoughts and images in
words. Afterwards I let them select, and then let them look
over what had been written, and finally they took on themselves
the actual writing....</p>

<p>One of the profoundest convictions impressed on Tolstoy's
mind by his educational experiments was that the peasants
and their children have a large share of artistic capacity,
and that art is immensely important because of its humanising
effect on them, and because it arouses and trains
their faculties. Unfortunately the works: literary, poetic,
dramatic, pictorial and plastic, now produced, are being
produced expressly for people possessed of leisure, wealth,
and a special, artificial training, and are therefore useless
to the people. This deflection of art from the service of
the masses of whom there are millions, to the delectation
of the classes of whom there are but thousands, appears to
him to be a very great evil.</p>

<p>He says with reference to two realms of art which he had
loved passionately, and with which he was specially familiar:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
music and poetry, that he noticed that the demands of the
masses were more legitimate than the demands of the classes.</p>

<p class="i2">Terrible to say, I came to the conviction that all that we
have done in those two departments has been done along
a false and exceptional path, which lacks importance, has no
future, and is insignificant in comparison with the demands
upon, and even with the samples of, those same arts which we
find put forward by the people. I became convinced that such
lyrical compositions as, for example, Poúshkin's 'I remember
the marvellous moment,' and such musical productions as Beethoven's
Last Symphony, are not so absolutely and universally
good as the song of 'Willy the Steward' or the melody of 'Floating
down the river, Mother Vólga'; and that Poúshkin and
Beethoven please us, not because they are absolutely beautiful,
but because we are as spoiled as they, and because they
flatter our abnormal irritability and weakness. How common
it is to hear the empty and stale paradox, that to understand
the beautiful, a preparation is necessary! Who said so? Why?
What proves it? It is only a shift, a loophole, to escape from
the hopeless position to which the false direction of our art,
produced for one class alone, has led us. Why are the beauty of
the sun and of the human face, and the beauty of the sounds of
a folk-song, and of deeds of love and self-sacrifice, accessible to
every one, and why do <i>they</i> demand no preparation?</p>

<p class="i2">For years I vainly strove to make my pupils feel the poetic
beauties of Poúshkin and of our whole literature, and a similar
attempt is being made by innumerable teachers not in Russia
alone; and if these teachers notice the results of their efforts,
and will be frank about the matter, they will admit that the chief
result of this attempt to develop poetic feeling, is to kill it; and
that it is just those pupils whose natures are most poetic who
show most aversion to such commentaries....</p>

<p class="i2">I will try to sum up all that I have said above. In reply to
the question: Do people need the <i>beaux arts</i>? pedagogues
usually grow timid and confused (only Plato decided the matter
boldly in the negative). They say: 'Art is needed, but with
certain limitations; and to make it possible for all to become
artists would be bad for the social structure. Certain arts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
certain degrees of art can only exist in a certain class of society.
The arts must have their special servants, entirely devoted to
them,' They say: 'It should be possible for those who are
greatly gifted to escape from among the people and devote
themselves completely to the service of art.' That is the
greatest concession pedagogy makes to the right of each
individual to become what he likes.</p>

<p class="i2">But I consider that to be all wrong. I think that a need to
enjoy art and to serve art, is inherent in every human being,
to whatever race or class he may belong; and that this need
has its right and should be satisfied. Taking that position
as an axiom, I say that if the enjoyment and production of
art by every one, presents inconveniences and inconsistencies,
the reason lies in the character and direction art has taken:
about which we must be on our guard, lest we foist anything
false on the rising generation, and lest we prevent it from
producing something new, both as to form and as to matter.</p>

<p>Tolstoy goes so far as to doubt whether, so long as no
suitable literature is produced for the people, it is even
worth their while to learn to read.</p>

<p class="i2">Looking closer at the results of the rudiments in the form in
which they are supplied to the masses, I think most people will
decide that the rudiments do more harm than good, taking into
account the prolonged compulsion, the disproportionate development
of memory, the false conception of the completeness of
science, the aversion to further education, the false vanity, and
the habit of meaningless reading acquired in these schools....</p>

<p class="i2">'Let us print good books for the people!'... How simple
and easy that seems&mdash;like all great thoughts! There is only
one obstacle, namely that there exist no good books for the
people, either here or in Europe. To print such books, they
must first be produced; and none of our philanthropists think
of undertaking <i>that</i> work!</p>

<p>Before closing this rapid summary of Tolstoy's educational
writings, let me quote a few more sentences which
sum up his essential position:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
In my articles on Education I have given my theoretic reasons
for considering that only freedom on the part of the pupils to
select what they will learn and how they will learn it, can
furnish a sound basis for any instruction. In practice I constantly
applied those rules to the schools under my guidance
...and the results were always very good both for the teachers
and the pupils, as well as for the evolution of new methods;
and this I assert boldly, for hundreds of visitors came to the
Yásno-Polyána school and know how it worked.</p>

<p class="i2">For the masters, the result of such relations with the pupils
was that they did not consider any methods they happened to
know, to be the best, but they tried to discover new methods
and made acquaintance with other teachers whose ways they
could learn. They tested fresh methods, and above all, they
themselves were always learning. A master never allowed
himself, in cases of failure, to think that it was the pupils' fault:
their laziness, naughtiness, stupidity, deafness or stuttering;
but he was convinced that the fault was his own, and for every
defect on the side of the pupil or pupils, he tried to discover a
remedy.</p>

<p class="i2">For the pupils the results were that they learnt eagerly,
always begged to have additional lessons on winter evenings,
and were quite free in class&mdash;which, in my conviction and
experience, is the chief condition of successful teaching. Between
the teachers and the pupils friendly and natural relations
always arose, without which it is not possible for a teacher to
know his pupils fully....</p>

<p class="i2">With reference to the methods of instruction, the results
were that no method was adopted or rejected because it pleased
or did not please the teacher, but only because the pupil, without
compulsion, accepted or did not accept it. But besides the
good results which unfailingly followed the adoption of my
method both by myself and by all&mdash;more than twenty&mdash;other
teachers (I say 'unfailingly' because we never had a single
pupil who did not master the rudiments)&mdash;besides these results,
the adoption of the principles of which I have spoken produced
this effect, that during fifteen years all the different modifications
to which my method has been subjected, have not only
not removed it from the demands of the people, but have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
brought it closer and closer to them.... In my school...
every teacher, while bringing his pupils forward, himself feels
the need of learning; and this was constantly the case with all
the teachers I had.</p>

<p class="i2">Moreover, the very methods of instruction themselves&mdash;since
they are not fixed once for all but aim at finding the easiest
and simplest paths&mdash;change and improve according to what
the teacher learns from the pupils' relation to his teaching.</p>

<p>The children had not to pay anything for attending the
school, and the relations between them and Tolstoy are
illustrated by the account a visitor has given of seeing
Tolstoy rush through a gate followed by a crowd of merry
youngsters who were snow-balling him. Tolstoy was
intent on making his escape, but on seeing the visitor he
changed his mind, acknowledged his defeat, and surrendered
to his triumphant pursuers.</p>

<p>Tolstoy does not stand before the world to-day primarily
as a school-master, and even were I competent to deal
with the subject, it would exceed the limits of this
biography to attempt a detailed criticism of his precepts
and practice; but he evidently possessed, as he claims in
one of his articles, 'a certain pedagogic tact'; and he is
clearly right in his belief that the rigid discipline of schools,
the lack of freedom and initiative, the continual demand
for silence and obedience, and the refusal to allow pupils to
criticise the lessons they receive, have a constantly stupefying
effect.</p>

<p>All that he allowed at Yásnaya Polyána was denied to
us when I was at Christ's Hospital, in 1868-1874; and
I look back on those six years of mental stultification as
the most wretched of my life. At the preparatory school
in Hertford, so stupefied were the little boys by terror
and discipline, that when the head-master (traditionally
an incarnation of all the virtues) became grossly harsh
and unfair, they could not see what was happening until
his insanity was so pronounced that the doctors had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
take him in hand: an event that occurred soon after I had
left for the upper school in London.</p>

<p>There, one of the masters (who evidently did not believe
that 'history is experience teaching by example') in intervals
between whacking the boys on their backs or hands
with a long cane, used, I remember, emphatically to
announce that 'dates and names are the most important parts
of history.' A Latin master, a barrister, who was usually
busy at some sort of law work when he should have been
teaching us, used to set us to learn by rote rules and illustrations
which we did not in the least understand. On one
occasion the example given in the grammar was:</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Opes irritamenta malorum effodiuntur.</i></p>

<p class="i2">Riches the incentives of crime are dug out of the earth.</p>

<p>The top boy had learnt the rule and illustration by heart
(which I never could do); but, departing from his usual
routine, the master unexpectedly asked which Latin word
corresponded to which English. Each of the first twenty-four
boys in the class in turn got caned and sent to the
bottom; so that by the time I, who had been last, had
come to the top, and it was my turn to reply, only one
possible combination remained untried, and I was able
to announce that <i>effodiuntur</i> meant 'are dug out of the
earth.' Unluckily there was another rule that day, and
over this I, in turn, came to grief, and was caned and sent
to the bottom.</p>

<p>In the drawing class I remember doing the outline of
a cube to the master's satisfaction, and being promoted
to the shading class. I had no idea how to shade, and
the attempt I made was certainly a very bad one; but instead
of receiving advice or assistance, my ears were boxed
so violently that I should be tempted to attribute to that
assault the slight deafness from which I have since suffered,
were it not that such treatment was so common at Christ's
Hospital, that none of the victims whose hearing may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
been impaired, could be sure to which of the masters they
owed that part of their preparation for the battle of life.</p>

<p>I feel sure the stultifying effects of such cruel and senseless
treatment would have been even more serious, had not
the school authorities, by some strange oversight, allowed
<i>one</i> really readable and interesting periodical to find a place
among the Sunday magazines and other sterilised literature
obtainable in the School Library. This one publication,
which I read ardently during my school years, was <i>Chambers's
Journal</i>. It contained novels by James Payn, and other
matter suited to my powers of mental digestion. From
smuggled copies of Captain Marryat's novels I also got
a good deal of culture: far more, I am sure, than from any
of the lessons we endured.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">To</span> one who admires Tolstoy's educational work, it is
somewhat disconcerting to see how scornfully he spoke of it
sixteen years later in his <i>Confession</i>. But that is always
his way: the old is useless and worthless and bad; only the
new, the unachieved, the fresh ideal, is admirable. For it,
he decries all that the past has produced&mdash;including himself
and his former work. He makes his points broadly
and powerfully, but to understand, we must discriminate,
and allow for an artistic temperament tempting him to
exaggerate. Let him however speak for himself, that the
reader may judge:</p>

<p class="i2">On returning from abroad I settled in the country, and happened
to occupy myself with peasant schools. This work was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
particularly to my taste, because in it I had not to face the falsity
which had become obvious to me and stared me in the face when
I tried to teach people by literary means. Here, also, I acted
in the name of Progress, but I already regarded Progress itself
critically. I said to myself: 'In some of its developments
Progress has proceeded wrongly; and with primitive peasant
children one must deal in a spirit of perfect freedom, letting
them choose what path of Progress they please.' In reality I
was ever revolving round one and the same insoluble problem,
which was: How to teach without knowing what? In the
higher spheres of literary activity I had realised that one could
not teach without knowing what; for I saw that people all
taught differently, and by quarrelling among themselves succeeded
only in hiding their ignorance from one another. But
here, with peasant children, I thought to evade this difficulty
by letting them learn what they liked. It amuses me now, when
I remember how I shuffled in trying to fulfil my desire to teach,
while in the depth of my soul I knew very well that I could not
teach anything needful, for I did not know what was needful.</p>

<p class="i2">After spending a year at school work, I went abroad a second
time, to discover how to teach others while myself knowing
nothing.</p>

<p class="i2">And it seemed to me that I had learnt this abroad, and in
the year of the peasants' Emancipation I returned to Russia
armed with all this wisdom; and having become an Arbiter, I
began to teach both the uneducated peasants in schools, and
the educated classes through a magazine I published. Things
appeared to be going well, but I felt I was not quite sound
mentally, and that matters could not long continue in that way.
And I should perhaps then have come to the state of despair
at which I arrived fifteen years later, had there not been one
side of life still unexplored by me, and which promised me
happiness: that was marriage.</p>

<p class="i2">For a year I busied myself with Arbitration work, the schools,
and the magazine; and I became so worn-out&mdash;as a result
especially of my mental confusion&mdash;and so hard was my struggle
as Arbiter, so obscure the results of my activity in the schools,
so repulsive my shuffling in the magazine (which always
amounted to one and the same thing: a desire to teach every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>body,
and to hide the fact that I did not know what to
teach) that I fell ill, mentally rather than physically, and threw
up everything, and went away to the Bashkírs in the steppes,
to breathe fresh air, drink <i>koumýs</i>, and live an animal life.</p>


<h3>1862</h3>

<p>Tired of and dissatisfied with his work, and thinking
he detected in himself signs of the malady that had
carried off two of his brothers, he set off in May
1862 (accompanied by his servant Alexis and
two of his pupils) to undergo a koumýs (soured and
fermented mares' milk) cure in the Samára steppes east of
the Vólga.</p>

<p>He went first to Moscow, and his friend Raévsky has told
how Tolstoy came up to him in the Club there, and mentioned
with great indignation and vexation that his brother
was playing cards and had lost Rs. 7000 in a few hours.
'How can men do such things?' said Tolstoy. Half-an-hour
later Raévsky saw Leo Tolstoy himself playing Chinese
billiards (a game something like bagatelle, played on a
board with wire impediments) and learnt that he had lost
Rs. 1000 to the stranger with whom he was playing!
This was, I believe, the last occasion on which Tolstoy played
any game for stakes he found it difficult to pay. The
occurrence led to the premature publication of his novel
<i>The Cossacks</i>, which he had had in hand for several years,
but to which he still intended to add a second part. Not
having Rs. 1000 (then about £150) available, he let
Katkóf, the well-known publicist, editor of the <i>Moscow
Gazette</i> and of the monthly <i>Russian Messenger</i>, have the
story for that sum paid in advance. This 'Tale of the
Year 1852,' as the sub-title runs, is based on Tolstoy's
Caucasian experiences. The circumstances which led to
its premature publication made the work repugnant to him,
and he never completed it.</p>

<p>Among those to whom he mentioned the occurrence were
the Behrs, of whom Miss Sophie was already so interested
in him that she wept at the news. At their home he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
always a welcome and intimate guest, and as time went on
he saw more and more of that family.</p>

<p>From Moscow he proceeded to Tvér by rail, and thence
by steamer down the Vólga to Samára.</p>

<p>At Kazán he stopped to visit his relation V. I. Úshkof:
and from Samára he wrote to Aunt Tatiána:</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>27 May 1862.</i></p>

<p class="i2">To-day I shall start to drive ninety miles from Samára to
Karalýk....</p>

<p class="i2">I have had a beautiful journey; the country pleases me very
much; my health is better, <i>i.e.</i> I cough less. Alexis and the
boys are alive and well, as you may tell their relations. Please
write me about Sergéy, or let him do so. Greet all my dear
comrades [probably the masters in the schools] for me, and
request them to write me of what goes on, and of how they are
getting on....</p>

<p>In another letter, dated 28th June 1862, he wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">It is now a month since I had any news of you or from home;
please write me about everybody: first, our family; secondly,
the (University) students [who acted as masters in the schools]
etc. Alexis and I have grown fatter, he especially, but we still
cough a little, and again he especially. We are living in a
Tartar tent; the weather is beautiful. I have found my friend
Stolýpin&mdash;now Atamán in Ourálsk&mdash;and have driven over to
see him; and have brought back from there a secretary; but I
dictate and write little. Idleness overcomes one when drinking
koumýs. In two weeks' time I intend to leave here, and I
expect to be home by St. Elijah's day [20 July, old style]. I am
tormented in this out-of-the-way place by not knowing what is
going on, and also by the thought that I am horribly behind-hand
with the publication of the magazine. I kiss your
hand....</p>

<p>Just when Tolstoy was leaving Karalýk a most unexpected
event was occurring at Yásnaya, where his sister
Mary was staying with Aunt Tatiána. Owing to the
denunciation of a police spy who, among other lies, pretended
to have discovered a secret door in Tolstoy's house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the police authorities decided to search his estate; and one
morning&mdash;to the immense astonishment of the neighbouring
peasants&mdash;police, watchmen, officials, and gendarmes,
under the command of a Colonel, appeared upon the
scene! In the school-house a photographic apparatus
was found: a thing sufficiently rare in a Russian
village in those days to evoke the suspicious inquiries
of the gendarme officer, to whom one of the student-teachers
chaffingly volunteered the information that it
was kept to photograph Herzen (the celebrated exile,
then living in London); but nowhere were any secret doors
found.</p>

<p>The floors of the stables were broken up with crowbars
to see if anything was hidden there. The pond was dragged,
but nothing more incriminating than crayfish and carp was
found. All the cupboards, drawers, boxes and desks in
the house were opened and searched, and the ladies were
frightened almost to death. A police-officer from Toúla
would not even allow Tolstoy's sister to leave the library
till he had finished reading aloud in her presence and
in that of two gendarmes, Tolstoy's Diary and letters,
which contained the most intimate secrets of his life and
which he had kept private since he was sixteen years
old.</p>

<p>Finding nothing incriminating at Yásnaya, the representatives
of law and order next betook themselves to the
other schools working in conjunction with Tolstoy, and
there also they turned tables and cupboards upside down,
seized exercise-books and primers, arrested the teachers,
and spread the wildest suspicions abroad among the peasants,
to whom school education was still a novelty held somewhat
in suspicion.</p>

<p>On receiving news of this event Tolstoy at once wrote
to his aunt, the Countess A. A. Tolstoy, asking her to speak
to those who knew him well and had influence, and on
whose aid he could rely. Said he:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
I cannot and will not let this affair pass. All the activity in
which I found solace and happiness, has been spoilt. Aunty is so
ill from fright that she will probably not recover. The peasants
no longer regard me as an honest man&mdash;an opinion I had earned in
the course of years&mdash;but as a criminal, an incendiary, or a coiner,
whose cunning alone has enabled him to escape punishment.</p>

<p class="i2">'Eh, man, you've been found out! Don't talk to us any
more about honesty and justice&mdash;you've hardly escaped handcuffs
yourself!'</p>

<p class="i2">From the landed proprietors I need not say what a cry of
rapture went up. Please write to me as soon as possible, after
consulting Peróvsky [Count V. A. P.] and Alexéy Tolstoy
[Count A. T., the dramatist and poet] and any one else you
like, as to how I am to write to the Emperor and how best
to present my letter. It is too late to prevent the injury
the thing has done, or to extricate myself, and there is no
way out except by receiving satisfaction as public as the
insult has been; and this I have firmly resolved on. I shall
not join Herzen; he has his way, I have mine. Neither will
I hide.... But I will loudly announce that I am selling my
estate and mean to leave Russia, where one cannot know from
moment to moment what awaits one....</p>

<p>At the end of an eight-page letter he mentions that the
Colonel of gendarmes, on leaving, threatened to renew his
search till he discovered 'if anything is hidden'; and
Tolstoy adds, 'I have loaded pistols in my room, and am
waiting to see how this matter will end.'</p>

<p>He also remarked: 'I often say to myself, How exceedingly
fortunate it was that I was not at home at the time!
Had I been there, I should certainly now be awaiting my
trial for murder!'</p>

<p>Soon after this, Alexander II spent some time at Petróvsky
Park, near Moscow. There Tolstoy presented a letter
claiming reparation, which an aide-de-camp undertook to
give to the Emperor; and some weeks later the Governor
of Toúla transmitted to Tolstoy the Emperor's expression
of regret for what had occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
It is easy to imagine the effect such an outrage as this
police-search would have on a man of Tolstoy's acute self-esteem,
and how it would intensify his hatred of Government.</p>

<p>After his return from Samára, he saw more of the Behrs
than ever. Fet, whom he introduced to them, thus records
his impressions of the family:</p>

<p class="i2">I found the doctor to be an amiable old gentleman of polite
manners, and his wife a handsome, majestic brunette who
evidently ruled the house. I refrain from describing the three
young ladies, of whom the youngest had an admirable contralto
voice. They all, notwithstanding the watchful supervision of
their mother and their irreproachable modesty, possessed that
attractive quality which the French designate by the words
<i>du chien</i> [lively, full of go]. The service and the dinner were
admirable.</p>

<p>Madame Behrs was on very friendly terms with Tolstoy's
sister, the Countess Mary; and before he went abroad
Tolstoy had frequently, at the house of the latter, played
with the children of both families. In 1862 he often visited
the Behrs at Pokróvskoe-Glébovo, where they lived in a
<i>dátcha</i> (country house) they occupied every summer. He
nearly always walked the eight miles from Moscow, and
often took long rambles with the family besides. The girls
had been educated at home, but Sophia Andréyevna, the
second daughter, had passed a University examination
entitling her to the diploma qualifying to teach both in
private and in State schools.</p>

<p>We may judge of Tolstoy's state of mind at this time by
an entry in his Diary, dated 23rd August: 'I am afraid of
myself. What if this be only a <i>desire</i> for love and not real
love? I try to notice only her weak points, but yet I love.'
And again, 'I rose in good health, with a particularly clear
head, and wrote easily, though the matter was feeble. Then
I felt more sad than I have done for a long time. I have
no friends at all. I am alone. I had friends when I served
Mammon, but have none when I serve truth.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
On 26th August he notes that Sónya (Miss Sophia Behrs)
gave him a story to read, written by herself, and her description
of the hero as a man of 'unusually unattractive
appearance, and changeable convictions' hit him hard;
but he was relieved to find that it was not meant for him.</p>

<p>On his thirty-fourth birthday, 28th August 1862 (old style)
he jotted down in his Diary the words: 'Ugly mug! Do not
think of marriage; your calling is of another kind.'</p>

<p>About this time the Behrs paid a two weeks' visit to
Madame Behrs' father's estate of Ívitsa, some thirty miles
from Yásnaya, and <i>en route</i> they stopped a couple of
days at Yásnaya to visit the Countess Mary. The day
after their arrival a picnic party was arranged with some
neighbours. It was haymaking time, and there was much
haystack climbing by the picknickers. The general impression
was that Tolstoy was in love with Lisa, the eldest
Miss Behrs: this opinion being fostered by the idea, then
common in Russia, that an elder daughter should be disposed
of before a younger daughter may be courted.</p>

<p>A few days later Tolstoy followed the Behrs to Ívitsa;
and here the scene occurred which he has utilised in <i>Anna
Karénina</i> when describing Lévin's proposal to Kitty&mdash;a scene
in which something approaching thought-reading takes place.</p>

<p>Sitting at a card-table with Miss Sophia Behrs, Tolstoy
wrote the initial letters of the sentence:</p>

<p>'In your family a false opinion exists about me and your
sister Lisa; you and Tánitchka should destroy it.'</p>

<p>Miss Sophia read the letters, understood what words they
stood for, and nodded her head.</p>

<p>Tolstoy then wrote the initial letters of another sentence:</p>

<p>'Your youth and need of happiness, to-day remind me
too strongly of my age and the impossibility of happiness.'</p>

<p>The nature of the Russian language (with its inflections
instead of particles, and the absence of articles) somewhat
diminishes the miracle; but the test was a very severe one,
and again the girl guessed the words aright. The two
understood one another, and their fate was practically sealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
The Behrs returned to Pokróvskoe-Glébovo in September.
Tolstoy accompanied them on the carriage-journey back to
Moscow and visited them every day, bringing music for the
young ladies, playing the piano for them, and accompanying
the youngest&mdash;whom he nicknamed 'Madame Viardot'
after the famous singer.</p>

<p>On the 17th of that month (the name's day of Sophia)
Tolstoy handed his future wife a letter containing a proposal
of marriage, which she gladly accepted. Her father,
displeased that the second daughter should be preferred to
the eldest, at first refused his assent. But Tolstoy was
strenuously insistent&mdash;I have even heard that he threatened
to shoot himself&mdash;and the doctor soon yielded to the united
persuasion of daughter and suitor.</p>

<p>The bridegroom's sense of honour led him to hand his
future wife the Diary, in which, mingled with hopes, prayers,
self-castigations and self-denunciations, the sins and excesses
of his bachelorhood were recorded. To the girl, who had
looked upon him as a personification of the virtues, this
revelation came as a great shock; but after a sleepless night
passed in weeping bitterly over it, she returned the Diary
and forgave the past.</p>

<p>To get married it was necessary first to confess and
receive the eucharist. Tolstoy's own experiences in this
matter are narrated in Chapter I of Part V of <i>Anna
Karénina</i>, where they are attributed to Lévin.</p>

<p>The marriage took place within a week of the proposal,
namely on 23rd September 1862, in the Court church of the
Krémlin, the bridegroom being thirty-four and the bride
eighteen years of age. When the ceremony was over the
couple left Moscow in a <i>dormeuse</i> (sleeping carriage), and
drove to Yásnaya Polyána, where Tolstoy's brother Sergéy
and Aunt Tatiána were awaiting them.</p>

<div class="caption">
Tolstoy in 1862, the year of his marriage.
</div></div>

<p>Fet records the letter in which Tolstoy informed him of
his marriage:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Fétoushka</span> [an endearing diminutive of Fet] <span class="smcap">Uncle</span>, or simply
<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Afanásy Afanásyevitch</span>!&mdash;I have been married
two weeks and am happy, and am a new, quite a new man. I
want to visit you, but cannot manage it. When shall I see you?
Having come to myself, I feel that I value you very, very
much. We have so many unforgettable things in common:
Nikólenka, and much besides. Do drive over and make my
acquaintance. I kiss Márya Petróvna's hand. Farewell, dear
friend. I embrace you with all my heart.</p>

<p>In another letter belonging to the same period he writes:</p>

<p class="i2">I am writing from the country, and while I write, from upstairs
where she is talking to my brother, I hear the voice of
my wife, whom I love more than the whole world. I have
lived to the age of thirty-four without knowing that it was
possible to love, and to be so happy. When I am more tranquil
I will write you a long letter. I should not say 'more tranquil,'
for I am now more tranquil and clear than I have ever been,
but I should say, 'when I am accustomed to it.' At present I
have a constant feeling of having stolen an undeserved, illicit,
and not-for-me-intended happiness. There ... she is coming!
I hear her, and it is so good!... And why do such good people as
you, and, most wonderful of all, such a being as my wife, love me?</p>

<p>It did not much disturb his happiness, when, before
Tolstoy had been married a fortnight, an event occurred which
might easily have led to very disagreeable consequences. On
3rd October the Minister of the Interior called the attention
of the Minister of Education to the harmful nature of the
<i>Yásnaya Polyána</i> magazine. This is what he wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">A careful perusal of the educational magazine, <i>Yásnaya
Polyána</i>, edited by Count Tolstoy, leads to the conviction that
that magazine ... frequently propagates ideas which apart
from their incorrectness are by their very tendency harmful....
I consider it necessary to direct your Excellency's attention
to the general tendency and spirit of that magazine, which
often infringes the fundamental rules of religion and morality....
I have the honour to inform you, Sir, of this, in the expectation
that you may be inclined to consider it desirable to
direct the special attention of the Censor to this publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Fortunately the decision of the matter did not lie with
the Minister of the Interior, but with the Minister of
Education, who on receiving this communication had the
magazine in question carefully examined, and, on 24th
October, replied that he found nothing harmful or contrary
to religion in its tendency. It contained extreme opinions
on educational matters, no doubt, but these, he said, should
be criticised in educational periodicals rather than prohibited
by the Censor. 'In general,' added the Minister:</p>

<p class="i2">I must say that Count Tolstoy's educational activity deserves
full respect, and the Ministry of Education is bound to assist
and co-operate with him, though it cannot share all his views,
some of which after full consideration he will himself probably
reject.</p>

<p>Other things besides the suspicion in which he was held
by the Minister of the Interior, tended to discourage Tolstoy.
His magazine had few subscribers and attracted but little
attention. The year's issue was causing him a loss of something
like Rs. 3000 (say about £450)&mdash;a larger sum than
he could well afford to throw away. So he decided to discontinue
it after the twelfth number. The month after
his marriage he also closed the school, which was too great
a tax on his time and attention.</p>

<p>It has often been said that the obstacles placed in his
way by the Government turned him aside from educational
work, but in speaking to me about it Tolstoy remarked
that really the main factor was his marriage, and his preoccupation
with family life.</p>

<p>Both he and his wife were absorbed by their personal
happiness, though from time to time small quarrels and
misunderstandings arose between them. So impulsive and
strenuous a nature as Tolstoy's was sure to have its fluctuations
of feeling, but on the whole the ties binding the
couple together grew stronger and closer as the months
passed into years.</p>

<p>The Countess's parents used to say: 'We could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
wished for greater happiness for our daughter.' The Countess
not only loved Tolstoy dearly as a husband, but had the
deepest admiration for him as a writer. He on his side
often said that he found in family life the completest happiness,
and in Sophia Andréyevna not only a loving wife
and an excellent mother for his children, but an admirable
assistant in his literary work, in which, owing to his careless
and unmethodical habits, an intelligent and devoted amanuensis
was invaluable. The Countess acquired remarkable
skill in deciphering his often extremely illegible handwriting,
and was sometimes able to guess in a quite extraordinary
way the meaning of his hasty jottings and incomplete
sentences.</p>

<p>One drawback to their almost complete happiness lay in
the fact that though active and possessed of great physical
strength, Tolstoy seldom enjoyed any long periods of uninterrupted
good health. In his correspondence we find
frequent references to indisposition. In early manhood, he
seems to have distended his stomach, and, especially after
the hardships he endured during the war of 1854-5, he was
subject to digestive troubles for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>Town life did not attract him. He had never felt at ease
in what is called high society; nor were his means large
enough to enable him to support a wife and family in a
good position in town. Still, towards the close of the year
of his marriage, he and the Countess spent some weeks in
Moscow.</p>


<h3>1863</h3>

<p>They were however soon back at Yásnaya. In February
Fet visited them there, and found them overflowing
with life and happiness.</p>

<p>On 15th May, after the Tolstoys and Fet had by some
chance just missed meeting at the house of a neighbouring
proprietor, Tolstoy wrote to his friend:</p>

<p class="i2">We just missed seeing you, and how sorry I am that we did!
How much I want to talk over with you. Not a day passes
without our mentioning you several times. My wife is not at
all 'playing with dolls.' Don't you insult her. She is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
serious helpmate, though now bearing a burden from which she
hopes to be free early in July. What won't she do afterwards?
We are <i>ufanizing</i><a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> little by little. I have made an important
discovery, which I hasten to impart to you. Clerks and overseers
are only a hindrance to the management of an estate.
Try the experiment of dismissing them all; then sleep ten hours
a day, and be assured that everything will get along <i>not worse</i>.
I have made the experiment and am quite satisfied with its
success.</p>

<p class="i2">How, oh how, are we to see one another? If you go to
Moscow with Márya Petróvna and do not come to visit us, it
will be dreadful offensive. (My wife, who was reading this
letter, prompted that sentence.) I wanted to write much, but
time lacks. I embrace you with all my heart; my wife bows
profoundly to you, and I to your wife.</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Business</i>: When you are in Orél, buy me 20 poods [720 lbs.]
of various kinds of twine, reins, and shaft-traces, if they cost
less than Rs. 2.30 per pood including carriage, and send them
me by a carter. The money shall be paid at once.</p>

<p>Fet soon availed himself of the invitation, and after driving
past the low towers which mark the entrance to the
birch alley leading to the house, he came upon Tolstoy
eagerly directing the dragging of a lake and taking all
possible care that the carp should not escape. The Countess,
in a white dress, came running down the alley, with a huge
bundle of barn-door keys hanging at her waist. After
cordially greeting the visitor, she, notwithstanding her
'exceedingly interesting condition,' leapt over the low railing
between the alley and the pond. It will however be
better to quote Fet's own account of his visit:</p>

<p class="i2">'Sónya, tell Nestérka to fetch a sack from the barn, and let
us go back to the house,' said Tolstoy&mdash;who had already
greeted me warmly, without losing sight of the carp-capturing
operations the while.</p>

<p class="i2">The Countess immediately detached a huge key from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
belt and gave it to a boy, who started at a run to fulfil
the order.</p>

<p class="i2">'There,' remarked the Count, 'you have an example of our
method. We keep the keys ourselves; and all the estate
business is carried on by boys.'</p>

<p class="i2">At the animated dinner table, the carp we had seen captured
made their appearance. We all seemed equally at ease and
happy....</p>

<p class="i2">That evening was one truly 'filled with hope.' It was a
sight to see with what pride and bright hope Tatiána Alexándrovna,
the kindest of aunts, regarded the young people she so
loved; and how, turning to me, she said frankly, 'You see,
with <i>mon cher Léon</i> of course things could not be otherwise.'</p>

<p class="i2">As to the Countess, life to one who in her condition leapt
over fences, could not but be lit up with the brightest of hopes.
The Count himself, who had passed his whole life in an ardent
search for novelties, evidently at this period entered a world
till then unknown, in the mighty future of which he believed
with all the enthusiasm of a young artist. I myself, during
that evening, was carried away by the general tone of careless
happiness, and did not feel the stone of Sisyphus oppressing
me.</p>

<p>Soon after this visit, on 28th June 1863, a son, Sergius,
was born. During the first eleven years of marriage, the
Countess bore her husband eight children, and another five
during the next fifteen years: making in all, thirteen
children in twenty-six years.</p>

<p>But we must turn back a few months to mention the
stories by Tolstoy which appeared during this year.</p>

<p>In the January number of the <i>Russian Messenger</i>, Katkóf
had published <i>The Cossacks</i>, which Tolstoy had kept back
to revise, and had only delivered in December.</p>

<p>In the February number of the same magazine appeared
<i>Polikoúshka</i>, the story of a serf who, having lost some
money belonging to his mistress, hangs himself.</p>

<p>These stories are referred to in the following letter from
Tolstoy to Fet, undated, but written in 1863:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Both your letters were equally important, significant, and
agreeable to me, dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch. I am living in a
world so remote from literature and its critics, that on receiving
such a letter as yours, my first feeling is one of astonishment.
Whoever was it wrote <i>The Cossacks</i> and <i>Polikoúshka</i>? And
what's the use of talking about them? Paper endures anything,
and editors pay for and print anything. But that is
merely a first impression; afterwards one enters into the meaning
of what you say, rummages about in one's head, and finds
in some corner of it, among old, forgotten rubbish, something
indefinite, labelled <i>Art</i>; and pondering on what you say,
agrees that you are right, and even finds it pleasant to rummage
about in that old rubbish, amid the smell one once loved. One
even feels a desire to write. Of course, you are right. But
then there are few readers of your sort. <i>Polikoúshka</i> is the
chatter of a man who 'wields a pen,' on the first theme that
comes to hand; but <i>The Cossacks</i> has some matter in it, though
poor. I am now writing the story of a pied gelding, which I
expect to print in autumn. [It did not appear till 1888!] But
how can one write now? Invisible efforts&mdash;and even visible
ones&mdash;are now going on; and, moreover, I am again up to my
ears in farming. So is Sónya. We have no steward; we have
assistants for field-work and building; but she, single-handed,
attends to the office and the cash. I have the bees, the sheep,
a new orchard, and the distillery. It all progresses, little by
little, though of course badly compared with our ideal.</p>

<p class="i2">What do you think of the Polish business? [the insurrection
of 1863, then breaking out]. It looks bad! Shall we&mdash;you
and I and Borísof&mdash;not have to take our swords down from
their rusty nails?...</p>

<p>The bees, which Tolstoy here places first among his out-door
duties, occupied much of his time, and he often spent
hours studying the habits of these interesting creatures.</p>

<p>Tourgénef, writing to Fet, commented on <i>The Cossacks</i>
as follows:</p>

<p class="i2">I read <i>The Cossacks</i> and went into ecstasies over it; so did
Bótkin. Only the personality of Olénin spoils the generally
splendid impression. To contrast civilisation with fresh, primeval
Nature, there was no need again to produce that dull,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
unhealthy fellow always preoccupied with himself. Why does
Tolstoy not get rid of that nightmare?</p>

<p>Several months later he wrote:</p>


<p class="i2">After you left, I read Tolstoy's <i>Polikoúshka</i> and marvelled
at the strength of his huge talent. But he has used up too
much material, and it is a pity he drowned the son. It makes
it too terrible. But there are pages that are truly wonderful!
It made a cold shudder run down even my back, though you
know my back has become thick and coarse. He is a master,
a master!</p>

<p>Tolstoy was now fairly launched on the life he was
destined to lead for sixteen years: a quiet, country life,
occupied with family joys and cares. These years followed
one another with so little change that the story of a decade
and a half can almost be compressed into a sentence.
Children came in quick succession, two great novels and an
<i>ABC</i> Book were produced, a large orchard was planted with
apple-trees, the Yásnaya Polyána property was improved,
and new estates were purchased east of the Vólga.</p>

<p>During the year 1863 Tolstoy wrote two plays, which
have never been published. One, a farcical comedy called
<i>The Nihilist</i>, was privately performed at home with great
success. The second, also a comedy, written on a topic of
the day, was called <i>The Infected Family</i>. Hoping to have
it staged, Tolstoy took it to Moscow early in 1864; but
the theatrical season, which in Russia ends at the commencement
of Lent, was already too far advanced; and
he never subsequently appears to have troubled himself to
have it either published or acted.</p>

<p>The Countess Tolstoy's brother, S. A. Behrs (who from
1866 when he was a boy of eleven, till 1878, spent every
summer with the Tolstoys) in his book, <i>Recollections of
Count Tolstoy</i>, gives much interesting information about
the life at Yásnaya. He mentions that it was a proverb
about the hard fate of penniless noblemen, that prompted
Tolstoy to take all possible care to provide for the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of his children; and the passage in the letter quoted above,
about the bees, sheep, new orchard and distillery with which
he was occupied, shows how this care was applied.</p>

<p>In his <i>Confession</i>, Tolstoy says of the years now under
review:</p>

<p class="i2">Returning from abroad I married. The new conditions of
happy family life completely diverted me from all search for
the general meaning of life. My whole life was centred at
that time in my family, wife and children, and in care to
increase our means of livelihood. My striving after self-perfection
and progress, was now again replaced by the effort
simply to secure the best possible conditions for myself and my
family.</p>

<p class="i2">So another fifteen years passed.</p>

<p class="i2">In spite of the fact that I regarded authorship as of no
importance, I yet, during those fifteen years, continued to
write. I had already tasted the temptation of authorship: the
temptation of immense monetary rewards and applause for my
insignificant work; and I devoted myself to it as a means of
improving my material position, and of stifling in my soul all
questions as to the meaning of my own life, or of life in
general.</p>

<p>Again, writing in 1903 of this middle period of his life,
Tolstoy says:</p>

<p class="i2">Then came a third, an eighteen-year period which may be
the least interesting of all (from my marriage to my spiritual
re-birth) and which from a worldly point of view may be called
moral: that is to say, that during those eighteen years I lived
a correct, honest, family life, not indulging myself in any
vices condemned by public opinion, but with interests wholly
limited to selfish cares for my family, for the increase of our
property, the acquisition of literary success, and all kinds of
pleasure.</p>

<p>(In the one place he speaks of 'fifteen years,' and in the
other of 'eighteen years'; but that is his way, and chronological
exactitude is not the important matter here.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
After the Emancipation, in many parts of Russia the
landlords had more or less serious difficulty with the
peasants, among whom stories were rife to the effect that
the Tsar intended to give them all the land, but had been
deceived by the officials into only giving half; and, for a
time, riots were not infrequent. There was no serious
trouble of this sort on Tolstoy's estate; but his sister
(whom I met at Yásnaya in 1902, long after her husband's
death and when she, a nun, had been allowed out of her
convent to visit her brother, after his very serious illness)
told me that on one occasion the peasants refused to make
the hay; and to save it from being lost, Tolstoy, his wife,
the members of the family, and the masters from eleven
neighbouring schools, all set to work with a will, and by
their own strenuous exertions saved the crop before the
weather changed.</p>

<p>On settling down to married life, Tolstoy formed the plan
of writing a great novel, and the epoch he at first intended
to deal with was that of the Constitutional conspiracy
which came to a head on the accession of Nicholas I to
the throne in December 1825. That quite premature
military plot was quickly snuffed out. So little were
things ripe for it, that many even of the soldiers who shouted
for a 'Constitution' (<i>Konstitútsia</i>) thought they were
demanding allegiance to Nicholas's elder brother Constantine,
who having married a Polish lady of the Roman Catholic
faith had renounced his right to the throne. While considering
the plan of his work, Tolstoy found himself carried
back to the scenes amid which his characters had grown up:
to the time of the Napoleonic wars and the invasion of
Russia by the French in 1812. Here was a splendid background
for a novel, and putting aside <i>The Decembrists</i> he
commenced <i>War and Peace</i>, a work conceived on a gigantic
scale, and that resulted in a splendid success.</p>


<h3>1864</h3>

<p>His attention, as we have already seen, was however not
wholly absorbed by literature, but was divided between that
and the management of his property. He had during his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
stay among the Kirghiz in the Province of Samára, noticed
how extremely cheap and how fertile was the land in those
parts. He therefore wished to purchase an estate there,
and visited the district in the autumn of 1864, probably
with that end in view. How long he stayed there I do not
know, but from a letter he wrote to Fet on 7th October,
saying, 'We start for home to-day and do not know how
we shall make our way to happy Yásnaya,' we
know when he returned. In November he again
wrote to Fet, and mentioned the laborious preparations
he was at that time making for <i>War and Peace</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">I am in the dumps and am writing nothing, but work painfully.
You cannot imagine how hard I find the preliminary
work of ploughing deep the field in which I must sow. To
consider and reconsider all that may happen to all the future
characters in the very large work I am preparing, and to weigh
millions of possible combinations in order to select from among
them a millionth part, is terribly difficult. And that is what I
am doing....</p>

<p>Late in that month he wrote again to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">This autumn I have written a good deal of my novel. <i>Ars
longa, vita brevis</i> comes to my mind every day. If one could but
make time to accomplish a hundredth part of what one understands&mdash;but
only a thousandth part gets done! Nevertheless
the consciousness that <i>I can</i> is what brings happiness to men
of our sort. You know that feeling, and I experience it with
particular force this year.</p>

<p>The year 1864 saw the publication of the first collected
edition of Tolstoy's works, and though they have been
already mentioned, it may be as well to give a complete
list of those twenty 'trials of the pen' which preceded the
appearance of <i>War and Peace</i>, and had already sufficed to
place Tolstoy in the front rank of Russian writers. The
following are their titles, with the years in which they
were first published. They suffice to fill four very substantial
volumes.</p>

<p>As I am sometimes asked where satisfactory versions of these
stories can be found, I may say that I think the best version
of <i>Childhood</i>, <i>Boyhood</i> and <i>Youth</i><a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is Miss Isabel Hapgood's,
and I make no apology for quoting a letter Tolstoy wrote
me on 23rd December 1901, concerning the volume, <i>Sevastopol</i>,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
translated by my wife and myself, and containing
the six stories marked * in the above list. I do this with
less hesitation, because his letter illustrates the cordial way
in which he encourages those who do any work he can
approve of, in connection with his own activity:</p>

<p class="i2">I think I already wrote you how unusually the volume
pleases me. All in it is excellent: the edition and the footnotes,
and chiefly the translation, and yet more the conscientiousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
with which all this has been done. I happened to
open it at <i>Two Hussars</i> and read on to the end just as if it
were something new that had been written in English.</p>

<p>One day in October Tolstoy went out for a ride on his
favourite horse, an English thoroughbred named Máshka.
His borzoi dogs Lúbka and Krylát accompanied him. After
he had ridden some way, a hare suddenly started up and
the dogs rushed after it. Tolstoy had not come out with the
idea of hunting, but on seeing the dogs chasing the hare he
could not restrain himself, and galloped after them, uttering
the hunting cry, 'Atoú!' The weather was bad, the ground
slippery, and the horse stumbled at a narrow ravine and fell,
dislocating and breaking its rider's arm. The horse ran
away, and Tolstoy, who was quite alone and several miles
from home, fainted. When he came to, he managed to
drag himself a distance of more than half a mile to the highroad,
where he lay in great pain. Some peasant carts passed
by, but at first he could not attract any one's attention.
When at last he was noticed, in order not to alarm his wife,
he asked to be taken to the hut of an old wife, Akoulína,
famed as a bone-setter. In spite of all that she and her
son Iván could do&mdash;soaping, pulling, twisting and bandaging
the arm&mdash;they could not set it, and Tolstoy continued to
suffer the greatest pain.</p>

<p>The Countess, who had meanwhile heard of the accident,
reached the hut late at night. She at once arranged to have
her husband taken home, and sent to Toúla for a doctor.
The latter arrived about 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and after administering
chloroform, succeeded, with the aid of two labourers who
were called in to assist, in setting the arm. On coming to,
Tolstoy's profound disbelief in the efficiency of doctors,
prompted him to send for another surgeon. After a consultation
the two physicians decided that everything had
been done properly, and that Tolstoy must lie up for six
weeks to allow the arm to recover. When that time was
up, Tolstoy asked for his gun and fired it off to test his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
arm. No sooner had he done so than he again felt great
pain. He thereupon wrote to his father-in-law, Dr.
Behrs, and on his advice went to Moscow to consult the
specialists. These differed among themselves, but after a
week's hesitation a fresh operation was decided upon,
and was carried out by two competent surgeons. This
time it was quite successful, and in due course the patient
completely recovered the use of his arm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Countess (now nursing her second child, a
daughter named Tatiána, who had been born on 4th October)
remained at Yásnaya, where her eldest child, Sergius, was
taken dangerously ill with smallpox and diarrh&oelig;a. This
was the first occasion on which Tolstoy and his wife had
been separated.</p>

<p>While in Moscow he concluded an arrangement with
Katkóf by which he received Rs. 500 (£75) per printed sheet
of sixteen pages for the serial rights in <i>War and Peace</i>,
which appeared in the <i>Russian Messenger</i>. This was just
ten times the amount which, when he wrote his first stories,
Nekrásof had mentioned as the highest rate paid to any one
for the magazine rights in a story.</p>


<h3>1865</h3>

<p>On 23rd January 1865, when Tolstoy had got over his accident,
he wrote Fet another of those jocular letters
which sometimes contain more of the real truth than
will bear saying seriously:</p>

<p class="i2">Shall I tell you something surprising about myself? When
the horse threw me and broke my arm, and when I came to
after fainting, I said to myself: 'I am an author.' And I am
an author, but a solitary, on-the-quiet kind of author.... In
a few days the first part of 'The Year 1805' [so the first part of
<i>War and Peace</i> was originally called] will appear. Please write
me your opinion of it in detail. I value your opinion and that
of a man whom I dislike the more, the more I grow up&mdash;Tourgénef.
He will understand. All I have printed hitherto
I consider but a trial of my pen; what I am now printing,
though it pleases me better than my former work, still seems
weak&mdash;as an Introduction must be. But what follows will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
be&mdash;tremendous!!!... Write what is said about it in the
different places you know, and especially how it goes with the
general public. No doubt it will pass unnoticed. I expect and
wish it to do so; if only they don't abuse me, for abuse upsets
one....</p>

<p class="i2">I am glad you like my wife; though I love her less than my
novel, still, you know, she is my wife. Be sure you come to
visit us; for if you and Márya Petróvna do not stay here
on your return from Moscow it will really, without a joke, be
too stupid!</p>

<p>In May 1865 one sees by a letter of Tolstoy's to Fet that
one of the children had been ill and he himself had been
in bed for three days and barely escaped a fever. His
wife's younger sister, Tánya, she of the contralto voice
who (with some admixture of his wife) served Tolstoy
as model for Natásha in <i>War and Peace</i>, was spending the
summer at Yásnaya, as she had done each year since her
sister's marriage. The Countess Mary and her children
were also there. The children, he says, were well, and out
all day in the open air. He adds:</p>

<p class="i2">I continue to write little by little, and am content with my
work. The woodcock still attract me, and every evening I
shoot <i>at them</i>, that is, generally, past them. My farming goes
on well, that is to say, it does not disturb me much&mdash;which is
all I demand of it....</p>

<p>In reply to a suggestion from Fet, he goes on to say that
he will not write more about the Yásno-Polyána school,
but hopes some day to express the conclusions to which
his three years' ardent passion for that work had brought
him. Then comes a reference to the state of agricultural
affairs after the Emancipation, and a passing allusion
to the question of famine&mdash;a subject destined to make
great demands on Tolstoy's attention in later years:</p>

<p class="i2">Our affairs as agriculturists are now like those of a share-holder
whose shares have lost value and are unsaleable on
'Change. The case is a bad one. Personally I only ask that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
it should not demand of me so much attention and participation
as to deprive me of my tranquillity. Latterly I have been
content with my private affairs; but the general trend&mdash;with
the impending misery of famine&mdash;torments me more and more
every day. It is so strange, and even good and terrible. We
have rosy radishes on our table, and yellow butter, and well-baked,
soft bread on a clean tablecloth; the garden is green,
and our young ladies in muslin dresses are glad it is hot and
shady; while <i>there</i> that evil hunger-devil is already at work,
covering the fields with goose-weed, chafing the hard heels of
the peasants and their wives, and cracking the hoofs of the
cattle. Our weather, the corn, and the meadows, are really
terrible. How are they with you?</p>

<p>The letter closes with advice to Fet to transfer his chief
attention from the land to literature, and a statement that
Tolstoy himself has done so, and is finding life less difficult.</p>

<p>When Tolstoy went out hunting hares and foxes with
borzoi dogs, Miss Tatiána Behrs (the Tánya alluded to
above) used often to accompany him.</p>

<p>Between this lady and Count Sergius Tolstoy (Leo's
elder brother) an attachment had grown up which caused
great distress to them both, for, besides being twenty-two
years older than the lady, Sergius was living with, and had a
family by, the gipsy mentioned in a previous chapter, though
he was not legally married. His affection for his family prevented
his yielding completely to his love for Tánya and
asking her to be his wife. The Behrs were quite willing
that he should do so, and the young lady would have
accepted him, and was much pained by the vacillation that
resulted from the battle between his love for her and his
affection for his family. Ultimately he resolved to be faithful
to the union he had formed, and, in order to legitimise
his children, went through the form of marriage with their
mother in 1867. Almost at the same time, Tánya, having recovered
from her disappointment, married a Mr. Kouzmínsky.</p>

<p>Here again one gets a slight glimpse of the experience of
life which has led Tolstoy, contrary to the opinion general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
among the Russian 'intelligents,' to advocate faithfulness
at all costs to the woman with whom one has once formed a
union.</p>

<p>A knowledge of Tánya's story adds to the interest with
which, in Tolstoy's great novel, one reads of Natásha
Róstof's troubles and ultimate happiness.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, Tolstoy visited the estate of
Nikólsky (which after the death of his brother Nicholas
had become his), and had the house there repaired. In
June the whole family moved to Nikólsky, where they
lived very quietly; Tolstoy continuing to write <i>War and
Peace</i>. His friend D. A. Dyákof's estate was only ten
miles away, and Tolstoy saw much of him at this time,
besides having him at other times as a frequent visitor
at Yásnaya. Dyákof was his chief adviser in agricultural
matters, as well as in his efforts to improve the stock
of his cattle, pigs and poultry. Almost the only other
visitors at Nikólsky were the Fets; and the poet records
meeting there the Countess's 'charming sister,' Tánya, and
experiencing violent antipathy for the sour koumýs, about
which Tolstoy was enthusiastic, and a large tub of which
stood near the front door.</p>

<p>While living at Nikólsky Tolstoy was invited for a fortnight
by a neighbouring landlord, Kiréyevsky, to a grand
hunt, in which the huntsmen wore special costumes, and
luxurious dinners were served in the woods. What interested
Tolstoy most in all this was not the hunt, but the
opportunity it afforded him of studying types of the old
and new aristocracy.</p>

<p>At this period of his life one hears of his playing the
guitar and singing passionate love-songs.</p>

<p>During the autumn of 1865 Tolstoy, accompanied by his
eleven-year-old brother-in-law, visited the battlefield of
Borodinó. They left Moscow in Dr. Behrs' carriage, with
post-horses. When the time came for them to have something
to eat, they found that the lunch basket had been
left behind, and they had only a small basket of grapes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Thereupon Tolstoy remarked to his companion, 'I am sorry,
not that we have left the basket of food behind, but because
your father will be upset and will be angry with his
man.' The journey took only one day, and they stayed
at the monastery erected in memory of those who fell in
the great fight. For two days Tolstoy investigated the
scene of the conflict which he was about to describe in
his novel, and he then drew the plan of the fight which
appears in that work. Even in 1865 there were but few
survivors of the campaign of 1812 to be found in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Tolstoy used at this time to spend whole days in the
Roumyántsef Museum in Moscow, studying books and manuscripts
relating to the times of Alexander I, and especially
to the reformatory and Masonic movements which then
sprang up in Russia, but were subsequently suppressed on
political grounds.</p>

<p>S. A. Behrs tells us that Tolstoy</p>

<p class="i2">was always fond of children, and liked to have them about
him. He easily won their confidence, and seemed to have
found the key to their hearts. He appeared to have no
difficulty in suiting himself to a strange child, and with a single
question set it completely at ease, so that it began at once to
chat away with perfect freedom. Independently of this, he
could divine a child's thought with the skill of a trained
educationalist. I remember his children sometimes running up
to him, and telling him they had a great secret; and when they
persisted in refusing to divulge it, he would quietly whisper
in their ears what it was. 'Ah, what a papa ours is! How did
he find it out?' they would cry, in astonishment.</p>

<p>He also says:</p>

<p class="i2">Gifted by nature with rare tact and delicacy, he is extremely
gentle in his bearing and conduct to others. I never heard him
scold a servant. Yet they all had the greatest respect for him,
were fond of him, and seemed even to fear him. Nor, with all
his zeal for sport, have I ever seen him whip a dog or beat
his horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
A servant who lived with him more than twenty years
has said: 'Living in the Count's house from my childhood, I
loved Leo Nikoláyevitch as though he were my father'; and
in another place he remarks:</p>

<p class="i2">The Count had a stern appearance, but treated the servants
excellently, and made things easy for all strangers whom he
met. He has a very good heart, and when he was cross with
me for anything, I, knowing his character, used at once to
leave the room, and when next he called me, it was as though
nothing unpleasant had happened.</p>

<p>Speaking of Tolstoy's later years the same servant says:</p>

<p class="i2">Leo Nikoláyevitch has now become quite a different man.
From 1865 to 1870 he was active in managing the estate, and
was fond of cows, bred sheep, looked after the property, and,
in a word, attended to everything. At that time he was hot-tempered
and impulsive. He would order the trap to be
brought when he wanted to go hunting. His man, Alexis,
would bring him his hunting-boots, and the Count would shout
at him, 'Why have you not dried them? You are not worth
your salt!' Alexis, knowing the Count's character, would
take the boots away, and bring them back almost directly.
'There! now they're all right,' the Count would say, and
would brighten up instantly.</p>

<p>His love of the country and his dislike of towns sprang
partly from his keen appreciation of the charm and loveliness
of Nature. He saw fresh beauty every day, and often
exclaimed: 'What wealth God has! He gives each day
something to distinguish it from all the rest.'</p>

<p>Sportsman and agriculturist himself, he maintains that
sportsmen and agriculturists alone know Nature. To quote
Behrs again:</p>

<p class="i2">No bad weather was allowed to interfere with his daily walk.
He could put up with loss of appetite, from which he occasionally
suffered, but he could never go a day without a sharp
walk in the open air. In general, he was fond of active movement,
riding, gymnastics, but particularly walking. If his
literary work chanced to go badly, or if he wished to throw off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the effects of any unpleasantness, a long walk was his sovereign
remedy. He could walk the whole day without fatigue; and
we have frequently ridden together for ten or twelve hours. In
his study he kept a pair of dumb-bells, and sometimes had
gymnastic apparatus erected there.</p>

<p>All luxury was distasteful to him; and much that ordinary
people regard as common comforts, seemed to him
harmful indulgences, bad for the souls and bodies of men.
Nothing could well be more simple than the arrangement
of his house at Yásnaya, substantial and solidly built as it
was, with its double windows, and the Dutch stoves so
necessary to warm a Russian house.</p>

<p>He was not at all particular about what he ate, but
objected to a soft bed or spring mattress, and at one time
he used to sleep on a leather-covered sofa.</p>

<p>He dressed very simply, and when at home never wore
starched shirts or tailor-made clothes, but adapted to his
own requirements the ordinary Russian blouse, having it
made of woollen stuff for winter, and of linen for summer.
His out-door winter dress was also an adaptation of the
sheepskin <i>shoúba</i> and peasants' <i>caftán</i>, made of the plainest
material; and these afforded such good protection from the
weather that they were often borrowed by members of the
household as well as by visitors.</p>

<p>During the writing of <i>War and Peace</i> Tolstoy generally
enjoyed good spirits, and on days when his work had gone
well, he would gleefully announce that he had left 'a bit of
my life in the inkstand.' One of his chief recreations was
to go out hare-hunting with borzoi dogs, and this he often
did in company with a neighbouring landed proprietor,
Bíbikof.</p>

<p>From October 1865 he ceased to keep his Diary, and did
not renew it during the period covered by this volume.</p>


<h3>1866</h3>

<p>On Twelfth Night a grand masquerade was held at
Yásnaya, and the festivities were kept up till past
two in the morning, and were followed by a troika
drive next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>That same January the family moved to Moscow, where
they hired a six-roomed apartment for Rs. 155 a month
(say about £23); and there they remained for six weeks
while the second part of <i>War and Peace</i> was being printed
for the <i>Russian Messenger</i>.</p>

<p>Among the friends Tolstoy saw most of at this time were
Aksákof and Prince Obolénsky. He also attended the
Moscow drawing school, and he tried his hand at sculpture&mdash;modelling
a bust of his wife. It does not appear, however,
that he continued this occupation long.</p>

<p>In May 1866 a second son, Ilyá, was born, and an
English nurse introduced into the family.</p>

<p>During this summer an infantry regiment was stationed
near Yásnaya, in which a young Sub-Lieutenant named
Kolokóltsef was serving, whom the Countess Tolstoy had
known in Moscow. He visited the Tolstoys, and introduced
to them his Colonel Únosha, and his fellow-officer
Ensign Stasulévitch (brother of the Liberal editor of the
monthly magazine, <i>The Messenger of Europe</i>), who had
been degraded to the ranks because, while he was on prison-duty,
a prisoner had escaped. Ensign Stasulévitch was
middle-aged, but he had only recently regained his rank as
officer and joined the regiment commanded by his former
comrade, Colonel Únosha.</p>

<p>One day Stasulévitch and Kolokóltsef called on Tolstoy
and told him that a soldier, serving as secretary in one of
the companies of the regiment, had struck his Company
Commander, and was to be tried by court-martial. They
asked Tolstoy to undertake the man's defence, and he,
having always regarded capital punishment with abhorrence,
readily agreed to do so.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the case were these. The soldier,
Shiboúnin, was a man of very limited intelligence, whose
chief occupation was writing out reports. When he had
any money he spent it on solitary drinking. The Captain
in command of his company, a Pole, apparently disliked
him, and frequently found fault with his reports and made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
him rewrite them. This treatment Shiboúnin bitterly
resented; and one day, when he had been drinking, on
being told to rewrite a document he had prepared, he
insulted and struck the Captain. By law the penalty for
a private who strikes his officer is death. Tolstoy nevertheless
hoped to save the man's life, and obtained permission
to plead on his behalf. The trial took place on 6th June,
and the members of the court-martial were Colonel Únosha,
Stasulévitch, and Kolokóltsef; the latter being merely a
light-headed youngster.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, when telling me of the incident, remarked that
of the four occasions on which he has spoken in public,
this was the time that he did so with most assurance and
satisfaction to himself. He had written out his speech; the
main point of which was that Shiboúnin was not responsible
for his actions, being abnormal, and having from the combined
effect of intemperance and the monotony of his
occupation, become idiotic and obsessed by an idea that
his Company Commander did not understand report writing,
and unfairly rejected work faultlessly done. The law decrees
a mitigation of sentence for crimes committed by
those who are not in the full possession of their senses; and
as this contradicts the paragraph allotting death as the sole
punishment for a soldier who strikes his officer, Tolstoy
argued that mercy should be extended to the prisoner.</p>

<p>The Court adjourned to consider its verdict, and (as
Tolstoy subsequently learnt) Stasulévitch was in favour of
mercy. The Colonel, who was more of a military machine
than a human being, demanded the death sentence, and the
decision therefore rested with the boyish Sub-Lieutenant,
who (submitting to his Colonel) voted for death.</p>

<p>Tolstoy wished to appeal (through his aunt, the Countess
A. A. Tolstoy) to Alexander II for a pardon; but with
characteristic disregard of details, he omitted to mention the
name of the regiment in which the affair had occurred, and
this enabled the Minister of War, Milútin, to delay the
presentation of the petition until Shiboúnin had been shot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
which occurred on 9th August. Tolstoy's appeal never,
therefore, reached the Emperor.</p>

<p>In contrast with the action of the Colonel and the
Minister, was that of the peasants of the district, who
flocked in crowds to see the prisoner; bringing him milk,
eggs, home-made linen and all the gifts their poverty could
afford. When the day of execution arrived, Shiboúnin went
quite impassively to his death; to all appearance incapable
of understanding what was happening. The people thronged
around the post to which he was to be tied&mdash;the women
weeping and some of them fainting. They fetched a priest
to perform Masses at his grave, and paid for the service to be
repeated all day. At night contributions of copper money,
linen, and candles such as are burnt in Russian churches,
were laid upon his grave. Next day the Masses were
recommenced, and were continued until the local police forbade
any more religious services, and levelled the grave that
the people might not continue to visit it.</p>

<p>The knowledge of such a difference between the spirit of
the governors and the governed, helps us once again to understand
Tolstoy's ultimate conviction that Government and
the administration of law are essentially evil things, always
tending to make the world worse and not better. In later
life we may be sure he would not have been content to
base his plea for mercy on merely legal grounds.</p>

<p>From time to time he continued to be troubled with ill-health;
for instance, in July 1866 he writes that he is
confined to the house with pains in the stomach which make
it impossible for him to turn quickly.</p>

<p>In November&mdash;contrary to what he had often said in the
past and was to return to in later life&mdash;he expresses his
sense of the importance of authorship. Fet, criticising
something in <i>War and Peace</i>, had quoted the words, <i>irritabilis
poetarum gens</i>, and Tolstoy, replying 'Not I,' welcomes
the criticism, begs for more, and goes on to say:</p>

<p class="i2">What have you been doing? Not on the Zémstvo [County
Council] or in farming (all that is compulsory activity such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
we do elementally and with as little will of our own as the ants
who make an ant-hill; in that sphere there is nothing good or
bad), but what are you doing in thought, with the mainspring
of your being, which alone has been, and is, and will endure
in the world? Is that spring still alive? Does it wish to
manifest itself? How does it express its wish? Or has it
forgotten how to express itself? That is the chief thing.</p>

<p>By the autumn of this year the railway southwards from
Moscow to Koursk had been constructed as far as Toúla,
making it easier to get from Yásnaya to Moscow, and to
the rest of Europe. Yet Tolstoy comparatively seldom
felt tempted to leave his much-loved, tranquil, busy,
country life, in which alone he found himself able to work
with the maximum of efficiency.</p>

<p>About this time he undertook the planting of a birch
wood, which has since grown up and become valuable.</p>


<h3>1867</h3>

<p>During the summer of 1867 Tolstoy, despite the dislike
and distrust of doctors&mdash;which he shares with Rousseau,
and which he has again and again expressed in his
works&mdash;was induced by the state of his health and
by his wife's persuasion, to consult the most famous Moscow
doctor of the time, Professor Zahárin, on whose advice he
drank mineral water during several weeks.</p>

<p>Writing to Fet he says:</p>

<p class="i2">If I wrote to you, dear friend, every time I think of you, you
would receive two letters a day from me. But one cannot get
everything said, and sometimes one is lazy and sometimes too
busy, as is the case at present. I have recently returned from
Moscow and have begun a strict cure under the direction of
Zahárin; and most important of all, I am printing my novel at
Ris's, and have to prepare and send off MSS. and proofs every
day under threat of a fine and of delayed publication. That is
both pleasant and also hard, as you know.</p>

<p>He goes on to criticise Tourgénef's novel, <i>Dym</i> (<i>Smoke</i>),
which had appeared that year:</p>

<p class="i2">About <i>Smoke</i> I meant to write long ago, and, of course, just
what you have now written. That is why we love one another&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>because
we think alike with the 'wisdom of the heart' as you
call it. (Thank you very much for that letter also: 'the
wisdom of the heart' and 'the wisdom of the mind' explain
much to me.) About <i>Smoke</i>, I think that the strength of poetry
lies in love; and the direction of that strength depends on
character. Without strength of love there is no poetry; but
strength falsely directed&mdash;the result of the poet's having an
unpleasant, weak character&mdash;creates dislike. In <i>Smoke</i> there is
hardly any love of anything, and very little poetry. There is
only love of light and playful adultery, and therefore the
poetry of that novel is repulsive. That, as you see, is just what
you write about it. Only I fear to express this opinion because
I cannot look soberly at the author, whose personality I do not
like; but I fancy my impression is the general one. One more
writer played out!</p>

<p>In November 1867 we find the whole family again
established for a while in a lodging in Moscow, where they
seem to have remained for a large part of the winter.</p>

<p>Here Fet visited Tolstoy and announced to him that he
had decided to arrange a Literary Evening for the benefit
of the famine-stricken peasants of Mtsensk, the district in
which Fet's estate lay. Tolstoy met the suggestion with
irony, maintaining that Fet had invented the famine; and
in reply to a request that he would ensure the success of
the evening by reading something, flatly refused to do so,
declaring that he never had and never could do such a thing
as read in public. Still, he lent Fet the chapter of <i>War and
Peace</i> containing the wonderful description of the retreat
of the Russian army from Smolénsk in fearful drought.
This as yet existed only in proof, not having been published.
(It forms Chapter V of Part X of Volume II in Mrs.
Constance Garnett's version: the best English rendering
of that novel.) Read by Prince Kougoúshef, the poet and
dramatist, it evoked thunders of applause.</p>


<h3>1868</h3>

<p>On 12th April 1868 Tourgénef, writing to Fet,
said:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
I have just finished the fourth volume of <i>War and Peace</i>.
There are things in it that are unbearable, and things that are
wonderful; and the wonderful things (they predominate) are so
magnificently good that we have never had anything better
written by anybody; and it is doubtful whether anything as
good has been written.</p>

<p>About the same time V. P. Bótkin wrote from Petersburg:
'Tolstoy's novel is having a really remarkable success;
every one here is reading it, and they not merely read it
but become enthusiastic about it.'</p>


<h3>1869</h3>

<p>The Epilogue was not completed till late in 1869. On
30th August Tolstoy writes: 'Part VI [<i>i.e.</i> Part II
of the Epilogue] which I expected to have
finished a month ago, is not ready'; and then in the next
sentence, he goes into ecstasies over Schopenhauer:</p>

<p class="i2">Do you know what this summer has been for me? An unceasing
ecstasy over Schopenhauer, and a series of mental
enjoyments such as I never experienced before. I have bought
all his works, and have read and am reading them (as well as
Kant's). And assuredly no student in his course has learnt so
much and discovered so much as I have during this summer. I
do not know whether I shall ever change my opinion, but at
present I am confident that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius
among men. You said he had written something or other on
philosophic subjects. What do you mean by 'something or
other'? It is the whole world in an extraordinarily vivid and
beautiful reflection. I have begun translating him. Won't you
take up that work? We would publish it together. After
reading him I cannot conceive how his name can remain
unknown. The only explanation is the one he so often
repeats, that except idiots there is scarcely any one else in the
world....</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he was starting next day for the
Government of Pénza to look at an estate he meant to buy
'in those out-of-the-way parts.' The servant who accompanied
Tolstoy has told how they travelled third class from
Moscow to Nízhni, and how Tolstoy chatted with his fellow-travellers,
so that many of them took him 'for a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
man.' The idea of buying the estate in Pénza was
ultimately abandoned.</p>

<p>He had by then completed the last part of <i>War and
Peace</i>, which was to appear complete in book form in
November. Two volumes had been published in 1866,
three more in 1868, and the sixth was not ready till this
year, 1869. (In subsequent editions the book was rearranged,
first into five and then into four volumes.)</p>

<p>Though he had so completely conquered the laziness of
which he accused himself in early manhood as to have
become a regular, indefatigable and extremely hard worker,
yet after the completion of so gigantic a task he felt
the need of recuperation and in summer wrote to Fet: 'It
is now my deadest time: I neither write nor think, but feel
happily stupid,' and he adds that he goes out shooting
woodcock and has killed eight at an outing.</p>

<p>That at this time he already felt something of the
strong repugnance he so strenuously expressed in later
years for luxury and profuse expenditure, is indicated
by his comment on the death of his acquaintance, the
author V. P. Bótkin, which took place in 1869. The
latter, a member of a wealthy family of tea-merchants, having
lived with economy till he knew his death was approaching,
then hired a splendid lodging in Petersburg, fitted it up
with all possible comfort and luxury, engaged a <i>chef</i> from
the kitchen of the Tsarévitch, paid daily attention to the
dinner <i>menu</i>, and engaged famous musicians to perform
quartets at his lodgings. To the magnificent feasts he gave
every day (at which, owing to the state of his health, he himself
participated chiefly as a spectator) he gathered a select
circle of those friends whose conversation interested him.
He told his brother that these arrangements for the close of
his life gave him the keenest pleasure, and that 'birds of
Paradise are singing in my soul.' On 4th October a quartet
and a banquet had been arranged as usual, and many guests
were expected&mdash;but V. P. Bótkin lay dead in his bed.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, hearing of this, wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
I was terribly shocked by the character of V. P. Bótkin's
death. If what is told of it is true, it is terrible. How is it
that among his friends not one was found to give to that
supreme moment of life the character suitable to it?</p>

<p>Before <i>War and Peace</i> was finished, the Countess had
borne four children, the fourth being a boy, born on 20th
May 1869, and christened Leo&mdash;nursing them all herself, as
she did her subsequent children, with two exceptions mentioned
later on. Her willingness to do her duty in this
respect was exceptional among women of her class, for the
employment of wet-nurses was extremely common in Russia.</p>

<p>Up to the age of ten, the children were taught Russian
and music by the Countess, and she even found time to make
their clothes herself till they reached that age. Besides
managing the household, her brother tells us that during the
composition of <i>War and Peace</i> she found time to copy it
out no less than seven times, a statement not to be taken
literally: for greatly as Tolstoy believes in the proverb that
'Gold is got by sifting,' and indefatigably as he revises his
work, not all the chapters of <i>War and Peace</i> will have been
altered that number of times. With Tolstoy the children
learnt arithmetic; and they learnt to read French out of
illustrated volumes of Jules Verne.</p>

<p>In all that concerned the education of the children, his
wife at this time willingly constituted herself the executant
of her husband's decisions, which were based largely on J. J.
Rousseau's <i>Émile</i>, and were relaxed only in so far as the
Countess was unable to carry them out, and as Tolstoy found
himself too much occupied with other affairs to attempt to
do so. Later on there was less accord between the parents.</p>

<p>With the first child they tried to do without a nurse, but
the attempt was unsuccessful, and subsequently Russian
nurses and foreign <i>bonnes</i> were employed.</p>

<p>Toys were not allowed in the nursery, but much liberty
was given to the children. No violent or severe punishments
were inflicted on them, and none but their parents
might award the punishments that were administered. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
aimed at gaining their children's confidence by timely
petting and kindly treatment.</p>

<p>If one of the children told a falsehood, this was treated as
a serious matter, and the punishment usually consisted in
the parents treating the child coldly. As soon, however, as
it showed that it was really sorry, the punishment ceased;
but a child was never persuaded to say it was sorry or to
promise not to repeat its fault.</p>

<p>All the grown-up people in the house were expected to
remember that children are apt to copy and imitate all that
they see and hear; and the children were not kept away
from the adults, except at lesson time. Consequently when
eight o'clock came and the children went to bed, Tolstoy
would often remark: 'Now, we are freer!'</p>

<p>Partly that they might learn English, partly because
Tolstoy believed that education was freer in England than
elsewhere, young English governesses were engaged to take
charge of his children from the age of three to nine. He
was extremely fortunate in his first choice, for the young
lady remained with the Tolstoys for six years, and after her
marriage continued in most friendly relations with the
whole family.</p>

<p>He aimed at acquainting the children with Nature, and
developing their love of it, of animals, and of insects. He
liked to let them realise their impotence and their complete
dependence on their elders, but he always did this with
kindly consideration.</p>

<p>The children were not allowed to order the servants
about, but had to <i>ask</i> them for anything they wanted;
and that a good example might be set, every one in the
house was expected to do the same. This was the more
important, because the peasant servants in Russia, even
after the Emancipation, were scarcely regarded as belonging
to the same race of human beings as their masters, and a
famous Russian author could say without any exaggeration,
'The balcony was rotten. Only servants went there; the
family did not go there.' But, to avoid giving a wrong impression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
I must here make a reservation. Just because
there was no idea of the two classes overlapping, and because
so wide a gap existed between them that they dressed quite
differently (the peasants having their own costume and style
of garments) very cordial and sincere good feeling often grew
up between master and man, or between proprietress and
servant, and real human interest, such as is shown in Tolstoy's
descriptions of the servants in <i>Childhood</i>, and in his other
stories. It was, and is, not at all unusual for Russian
servants to intervene in the conversation of the family or
visitors; and the whole relation between employers and
employed was quite different to what it is in England,
where on Sundays the maid might be mistaken for her
mistress, except that she often looks more attractive than
the latter.</p>

<p>The plan adopted in the Yásno-Polyána school, where
no child was obliged to learn anything it did not care to
learn, had to be abandoned in the family; but some scope
was allowed to the children to reject what they had no
capacity for, and they were never punished for neglecting
to prepare lessons, though they were rewarded when they
learnt well.</p>

<p>To illustrate Tolstoy's way of developing the minds of
those about him, Behrs tells of his own case when, as a
youth, he stayed at Yásnaya:</p>

<p class="i2">Regardless of my youth at the time, I remember that Tolstoy
discussed quite seriously with me all the scientific and philosophic
questions it came into my head to put to him. He
always answered simply and clearly, and never hesitated to
admit the fact if he himself did not understand this or that
matter. Often my talk with him took the form of a dispute,
on which I embarked in spite of my consciousness of his
immense superiority.</p>

<p>The children were always eager to go for walks with their
father, to answer his call to practise Swedish gymnastics, and
to be on his side in any game he taught them. In winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
they skated a good deal; but clearing the snow off the
pond under his leadership was an even greater pleasure than
the skating itself.</p>

<p>Before breakfast he would go for a walk with his brother-in-law,
or they would ride down to bathe in the river that
flows by one side of the estate. At morning coffee the
whole family assembled, and it was generally a very merry
meal, Tolstoy being up to all sorts of jokes, till he rose with
the words, 'One must get to work,' and went off to his study,
taking with him a tumbler full of tea. While at work in
his room not even his wife was allowed to disturb him;
though at one time his second child and eldest daughter,
Tatiána, while still quite a little girl, was privileged to
break this rule. The rare days (generally in summer)
when he relaxed, were very welcome to the children, for
their father's presence always brought life and animation
with it. Generally after dinner, before resuming work,
he would read a book not directly connected with the task
he had in hand. It was often an English novel; and
we hear of his reading Anthony Trollope with approval,
Mrs. Henry Wood, who, he says, made a great impression
on him, and Miss Braddon. His dislike of George Sand
remained unshaken, and he considered <i>Consuelo</i> to be a
mixture of the pretentious and the spurious. Goethe
(especially <i>Faust</i>) he admired; while Molière's plays and
Hugo's <i>Les Misérables</i> appealed to him very strongly
indeed. In the evening he was fond of playing duets with
his sister. He used to find it hard to keep up with her in
playing long pieces with which he was not quite familiar,
and when in difficulties he would say something to make
her laugh, and cause her to play slower. If he did not
succeed by means of this ruse, he would sometimes stop and
solemnly take off one of his boots, as though that must
infallibly help him out of the difficulty; and he would then
recommence, with the remark, 'Now, it will go all right!'</p>

<p>During the early years of his married life few visitors
came to Yásnaya, except the numerous members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Tolstoy-Behrs families, who stayed there chiefly in summer.
The poet A. A. Fet, D. A. Dyákof, whom he had known
from boyhood and had described in <i>Youth</i>, N. N. Stráhof,
the philosopher and critic, for whose judgment he had
great respect and whom he frequently consulted throughout
his literary career, and Prince L. D. Ouroúsof, a cousin of
the Prince Ouroúsof he had known during the siege of
Sevastopol, seem to have been almost the only friends who
visited him in the years first following his marriage; and
this suited Tolstoy very well, for to entertain many visitors
would have seriously interrupted the absorbing work in
which he was continually engaged.</p>

<p>Fet has so often been mentioned in this volume that it is
time to devote a few lines to describing a man who has
come in for much abuse on account of the anti-Emancipationist
sympathies expressed in some of his writings. Like
Tolstoy, he had grown up with no idea that it is incumbent
on men of education and capacity to organise the society of
which they are members, or by political action to remedy
such abuses as inevitably arise among human beings who
do not keep the task of systematic social organisation constantly
in view. Of the impression Fet's political opinions
made on the Liberals, one may judge by a remark Tourgénef
addressed to him in a letter written in 1874: 'Twenty years
ago, at the height of Nicholas I's <i>régime</i>, you dumbfounded
me by announcing your opinion that the mind of man
could devise nothing superior to the position of the Russian
aristocracy of that day, nor anything nobler or more
admirable.' The Liberals saw in Fet a political reactionary&mdash;and
so he was; but any one who reads his <i>Recollections</i>
may also see how large a measure of personal worth can be
combined with political indifferentism&mdash;a quality many
Russians of his generation were brought up to regard as a
virtue. In private life he was a really worthy man, and
Tolstoy once very truly remarked to him:</p>

<p class="i2">There are some people whose talk is far above their actual
morality; but there are also some whose talk is below that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
level. You are one who is so afraid of his sermon being above
his practice, that you intentionally talk far below your actual
practice.</p>

<p>While still a young cavalry officer Fet began to write
poetry, for which he had real talent; and after leaving
the army he continued his literary career as an Art-for-Art's-sake-ist,
producing verse translations of Virgil,
Horace, Ovid, Juvenal, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, and
Persius, besides original works of his own in prose and
verse, and (after Tolstoy's suggestion, already recorded)
translations from the German of Schopenhauer's <i>The World
as Will and Idea</i>, and Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>In his dislike, or perhaps one should say ignorance, of
politics, commerce, and that great industrial revolution of
the Western world that has been the most conspicuous
achievement of the last one hundred and fifty years, as well
as in his love of pure art, chiefly literary, he had much in
common with Tolstoy. They could talk with profound
sympathy of all that related to art, and they were alike
in their love of country life and in their relation to agriculture,
as well as in the fact that the great problems of life
centred for them round their own personality rather than
around the community to which they belonged. Patriotic
by instinct, it was no part of their philosophy to be so; at
least they never dreamed of that newer patriotism which
seeks to manage the production and distribution of the
national wealth so that every member of the community
may have an opportunity to live in decent conditions.
They had therefore at this period much in common; and
one sees by Tolstoy's letters how greatly they enjoyed each
other's society, though a time was coming when their
friendship would wane.</p>

<p>Tolstoy had a strong dislike of leaving home even for
a few days. When it was absolutely necessary for him to
go to Moscow he would grumble at his hard fate, and
Behrs, when he accompanied him, noticed how town life
depressed Tolstoy, making him fidgety and even irritable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
When returning from a journey, or a hunting expedition,
he would express his anxiety by exclaiming, 'If only all's
well at home!' After he had been away from Yásnaya,
Tolstoy never failed to give the home party full and amusing
accounts of what he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>A distinguishing feature of Tolstoy, already remarked
upon, but so strongly marked that it can hardly be insisted
on too much, was the ardent and whole-hearted way in which
he threw himself into whatever occupation he took up. On
this point Prince D. D. Obolénsky says: 'I have seen
Count L. N. Tolstoy in all phases of his creative activity....
Whatever his occupation, he did it with conviction,
firmly believing in the value of what he was doing, and
always fully absorbed by it. I remember him as a man
of the world, and have met him at balls, and I remember
a remark he once made, "See what poetry there is in
women's ball-dresses, what elegance, how much thought,
how much charm even in the flowers pinned to the dresses!"
I remember him as an ardent sportsman, as a beekeeper, as
a gardener; I remember his enthusiasm for farming, for
tree planting, fruit culture, horse breeding, and much else.'</p>

<p>A housekeeper who was with him for nine years, said of him:</p>

<p class="i2">The Count himself looked after everything, and demanded
extreme cleanliness in the cowhouse and in the pig-styes and
in the sheep-cot. In particular he delighted in his pigs, of
which he had as many as 300, paired off in separate styes....
There the Count would not allow the least dirt. Every day I
and my assistants had to wash them all, and wipe the floor and
walls of the styes; then the Count, on passing through the
piggery of a morning, would be very pleased, and would
remark aloud: 'What management!... What good management!'
But God have mercy on us if he noticed the least
dirt! That at once made him shout out angrily.... The
Count was very hasty, and a doctor who used to come to
Yásnaya said to him more than once in my presence: 'You
must not get so angry, Count, it is very bad for your
health....' 'I can't help it,' he would reply. 'I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
restrain myself, but can't do it. That, it seems, is the way I
am made!'... His farming gave the Count a good revenue
in those days. Besides the pigs and their litters, he had 80
cows, 500 good sheep, and very many fowls. We used to make
excellent butter, which we sold in Moscow at 60 copecks
[about 19 pence] a lb.</p>

<p>His management of property was characteristically personal.
He never took shares in any joint-stock company,
but he bought land, bred cattle and horses of good quality,
planted a large apple-orchard, as well as a quantity of other
trees, and in general he acquired property he could manage
himself, or (for he entrusted the management of his Samára
estates to stewards) over which he had full control. He has
always been more alive to the dangers and evils of commercial
companies and large engineering and industrial
undertakings, than to the good they have achieved by
irrigating arid lands, uniting distant realms, and lightening
man's toil by making iron bear some of his burdens for him.</p>

<p>Tolstoy furnishes an example of the well-known fact that
men of artistic temperament are often untidy. Though he
acknowledges the advantages of neatness in general, he often
remarked that it is a quality most frequently found in
shallow natures. He himself simply could not, and therefore
did not try to, keep his things in order. When he
undressed he let his clothes or boots drop where he stood;
and if he happened to be moving from place to place, his
garments remained strewn about the room, and sometimes
on the floor. Behrs remarks.</p>

<p class="i2">I noticed that to pack his things for a journey cost him great
effort, and when I accompanied him I used very willingly to do
it for him, and thereby pleased him very much. I remember
that once, for some reason, I did not at all wish to pack for
him. He noticed this, and with characteristic delicacy did not
ask me to, but put his things into his portmanteau himself; and
I can assert positively that no one else, were they to try, could
have got them into such fearful disorder as they were in, in that
portmanteau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
It was a peculiarity of Tolstoy's that he not only liked to
have his own sleep out without being disturbed, but that he
never could or would wake any one from sleep, and in cases
of absolute necessity would ask some one else to relieve him
of that disagreeable task.</p>

<p>Behrs recounts that when they sat up late, the man-servant
sometimes fell asleep in his chair and omitted to serve up
the cold supper. Tolstoy would never allow him to be disturbed
on these occasions, but would himself go to the
pantry to fetch the supper, and would do this stealthily,
and with the greatest caution, so that it became a kind of
amusing game. He would get quite cross with Behrs if the
latter accidentally let the plates clatter or made any other
noise.</p>

<p>Many years later, alluding in my presence to this peculiarity
of his, Tolstoy remarked, 'While a man is asleep he
is at any rate not sinning.'</p>


<h3>1870</h3>

<p>On 4th February 1870 Tolstoy wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I received your letter, dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch, on 1st
February, but even had I received it somewhat sooner I could
not have come. You write, 'I am <i>alone, alone</i>!' And when I
read it I thought, What a lucky fellow&mdash;<i>alone</i>! I have a wife,
three children, and a fourth at the breast, two old aunts, a nurse,
and two housemaids. And they are all ill together: fever, high
temperature, weakness, headaches, and coughs. In that state
your letter found me. They are now beginning to get better,
but out of ten people, I and my old aunt alone turn up at the
dinner table. And since yesterday I myself am ill with my
chest and side. There is much, very much, I want to tell you
about. I have been reading a lot of Shakespear, Goethe,
Poúshkin, Gógol, and Molière, and about all of them there
is much I want to say to you. I do not take in a single
magazine or newspaper this year, and I consider it very useful
not to.</p>

<p>S. A. Behrs tells us that Tolstoy 'never read newspapers,
and considered them useless, and when they contain false
news, even harmful. In his humorous way he would some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>times
parody a newspaper style when speaking of domestic
affairs.' His attitude towards journalists and critics (except
his friend Stráhof) was rather scornful, and he was indignant
when any one classed them even with third-rate authors.
He considered that it is a misuse of the printing-press to
publish so much that is unnecessary, uninteresting, and
worst of all, inartistic. He seldom read criticisms of his
own work. 'His feeling towards periodicals in general had
its source in his intense dislike of the exploitation of works
of art. He would smile contemptuously at hearing it suggested
that a real artist produces his works for the sake of
money.'</p>

<p>Having said this much about his characteristics and
peculiarities, let us note the extent to which his life and
mode of thought at this time approximated to his later
teaching. His humane relations towards the peasants, his
condemnation of many of the manifestations of modern
civilisation, his simplicity in household matters and dress,
his exemplary family life, humane educational ideals, deep
love of sincerity and of industry (including physical labour),
his ardent search for truth and for self-improvement, his
gradually increasing accessibility to and regard for others,
his undoubted love of family and his hatred of violence&mdash;indicate
that the ideals of his later life were not very far
from him, even before the commencement of the conversion
told of in his <i>Confession</i>.</p>

<p>On 17th February Tolstoy writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I hoped to visit you the night of the 14th, but could not do
so. As I wrote you, we were all ill,&mdash;I last. I went out
yesterday for the first time. What stopped me was pain in the
eyes, which is increased by wind and sleeplessness. I now, to
my great regret, have to postpone my visit to you till Lent. I
must go to Moscow to take my aunt to my sister's, and to see
an oculist about my eyes.</p>

<p class="i2">It is a pity that one can only get to your place after passing
a sleepless, cigarette-smoky, stuffy, railway-carriage, conversational
night. You want to read me a story of cavalry life....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
And I don't want to read you anything, because I am not
writing anything; but I very much want to talk about Shakespear
and Goethe and the drama in general. This whole winter
I am occupied only with the drama; and it happens to me, as
it usually happens to people who till they are forty have not
thought of a certain subject or formed any conception of it,
and then suddenly with forty-year-old clearness turn their
attention to this new untasted subject&mdash;it seems to them that
they discern in it much that is new. All winter I have enjoyed
myself lying down, drowsing, playing bézique, going on snowshoes,
skating, and most of all lying in bed (ill) while characters
from a drama or comedy have performed for me. And they
perform very well. It is about that I want to talk to you. In
that, as in everything, you are a classic, and understand the
essence of the matter very deeply. I should like also to read
Sophocles and Euripides.</p>

<p>There we see Tolstoy, as always, ardently devoting his
attention to some great subject&mdash;which happens, this time,
to be dramatic art. So keen is he, that his mind is full
of it whatever else he may be doing; and so vivid is his
imagination that the characters of the plays perform
for him whether he is standing up or lying down. How
real a grip he obtained of the subject with very little
theatre-going, was shown seventeen years later, when he
wrote one of the most powerful dramas ever produced,
and followed it up by an excellent comedy: both pieces
being so good that they are constantly revived in
Russian theatres, besides having achieved success in other
countries.</p>

<p>At the point we have reached there was no break in the
manner of Tolstoy's life. He continued to live quietly at
Yásnaya, and to concern himself chiefly with literature,
and also with the management of his estates and the welfare
of his family. Children continued to be born in rapid
succession, and with the increasing family his means also
increased. But we have come to the middle of that tranquil
period of sixteen years which succeeded his marriage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
here, while&mdash;as one would say of another man&mdash;he was
indefatigably studying the drama; or while&mdash;as one is
inclined to say of him&mdash;he was resting and recuperating
before undertaking his next great work, it is convenient to
close this chapter.</p>

<h3>1870</h3>

<p>As he grew older Tolstoy's love of outdoor exercise tended
more towards activity serving a useful productive
purpose, and one finds a hint of this in the following
letter to Fet, dated 11th May 1870:</p>

<p class="i2">I received your letter, dear friend, when returning perspiring
home from work, with axe and spade, and when therefore
I was a thousand miles from things artistic in general,
and from our business in particular. On opening the letter
I first read the poem and felt a sensation in my nose. On
coming home to my wife I tried to read it to her, but could not
do so for tears of emotion. The poem is one of those rare ones
in which not a word could be added or subtracted or altered:
it is a live thing, and admirable....</p>

<p class="i2">I have just served for a week as juryman, and found it very
interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>The next letter refers to the fact that Tolstoy did his
best literary work in winter, when he often spent almost
the whole day, and sometimes part of the night, at it; that
was the time when his 'sap flowed':</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>2 Oct. 1870.</i></p>

<p class="i2">It is long since we met, and in my winter condition, which
I am now entering, I am specially glad to see you. I have been
shooting; but the sap is beginning to flow, and I am collecting
it as it drips. Whether it be good or bad sap, it is pleasant to
let it flow in these long wonderful autumn evenings.... A
grief has befallen me; the mare is ill. The veterinary says her
wind has been broken, but I cannot have broken it.</p>

<p>The Franco-Prussian war, which commenced at this time,
interested Tolstoy keenly. He had come into contact with
the French, in the Crimea, before the Napoleonic autocracy
had long held sway; and he had visited France in 1857
and 1860, before the effect of that putrescent influence had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
become fully apparent. Neither the idea of German national
unity, nor Bismarck's and Moltke's ideal of efficient organisation
and discipline, were things that much appealed to
Tolstoy. So it happened that not only were all his sympathies
on the side of the French, but he also felt assured
of their triumph. His friend Prince Ouroúsof used to
write letters to Katkóf's <i>Moscow Gazette</i> demonstrating
by analogies with games of chess, that the French were
continually drawing the German armies into more and
more desperate positions in which they must soon be quite
destroyed. When, on the contrary, the French were utterly
defeated, it came to him as a complete surprise; which all
tends to illustrate the fact that men of great intellectual
power, living isolated on their country estates, may at times
go very considerably wrong in their estimate of the trend
of some of the forces that influence the world.</p>

<p>On 12 February 1871 a daughter was born, who was
christened Mary. In later life she, of all his children, was
the one most deeply influenced by her father's teaching.
The Countess, who, as already mentioned, made a point of
nursing her own children, owing to the neglect of an
attendant, became unable to do so in this instance before
the child was many weeks old, and a wet-nurse was engaged;
but as soon as the mother saw her child at a stranger's
breast she burst into a flood of jealous tears, dismissed the
nurse on the spot, and ordered the child to be fed with
a bottle. Tolstoy, when he heard what had happened,
declared that his wife had only shown the jealous affection
natural to a true mother.</p>


<h3>1870-71</h3>

<p>During that winter Tolstoy devoted himself strenuously
to the study of Greek. On hearing of this, Fet felt so
sure that Tolstoy would not succeed, that he
announced his readiness to devote his own skin
for parchment for Tolstoy's diploma of proficiency when
the latter should have qualified himself to receive it.
Accordingly, in December, Tolstoy wrote him as follows:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
I received your letter a week ago, but have not answered
because from morning to night I am learning Greek. I am
writing nothing, only learning; and to judge by information
reaching me through Borísof, your skin (to be used as parchment
for my diploma in Greek) is in some danger. Improbable
and astounding as it may seem, I have read Xenophon, and can
now read him at sight. For Homer, a dictionary and some
effort is still necessary. I eagerly await a chance of showing
this new trick to some one. But how glad I am that God sent
this folly upon me! In the first place I enjoy it; and secondly,
I have become convinced that of all that human language has
produced truly beautiful and simply beautiful, I knew nothing
(like all the others who know but do not understand); and
thirdly, because I have ceased to write, and never more will
write, wordy rubbish. I am guilty of having done so; but by
God I won't do it any more! Explain to me, for Heaven's
sake, why no one knows Esop's fables, or even delightful
Xenophon, not to mention Plato and Homer, whom I still have
before me? In so far as I can as yet judge, our translations,
made on German models, only spoil Homer. To use a banal
but involuntary comparison: they are like boiled and distilled
water, while he is like water fresh from the spring, striking the
teeth with its sun-lit sparkle: even its specks only making it
seem still clearer and fresher.... You may triumph: without
a knowledge of Greek, there is no education. But what kind
of knowledge? How is it to be got? What is the use of it?
To this I have replies clear as daylight.</p>


<h3>1871</h3>

<p>S. A. Behrs tells us, 'I know for a fact that he learnt
the language and read Herodotus in three months.' While
in Moscow that winter, he visited Leóntief, then
Professor of Greek at the Katkóf Lyceum, to talk
about Greek literature. Leóntief did not wish to believe
in the possibility of his having learnt Greek so rapidly,
and proposed that they should read something at sight.
It happened that they differed as to the meaning of
three passages; but after a little discussion the Professor
admitted that the Count's interpretations were right.</p>

<p>Tolstoy felt the charm of the literary art of the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
world, and so keen was his power of entering into the minds
of those of whom he read, and so different to his own was
the Greek outlook upon life, that the contradiction produced
in him a feeling of melancholy and apathy profound
enough to affect his health.</p>

<p>What clash of ideals it was that produced this result we
may guess when we consider how from his earliest years
he had been attracted by the Christian ideal of meekness,
humility, and self-sacrifice, and how little this accords
with the outlook on life of the ancient Greeks. In a book
written nearly forty years later, Tolstoy tells us that 'If, as
was the case among the Greeks, religion places the meaning
of life in earthly happiness, in beauty and in strength, then
art successfully transmitting the joy and energy of life,
would be considered good art' [good, that is, in its subject-matter
of feeling conveyed] but art transmitting the opposite
feelings would be bad art.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Again in the same work he
says that the esthetic theory he is combating, seeks to make
it appear 'that the very best that can be done by the art
of nations after 1900 years of Christian teaching, is to
choose as the ideal of life the ideal held by a small, semi-savage,
slave-holding people who lived 2000 years ago,
imitated the nude human body extremely well, and erected
buildings pleasant to look at.'<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>To wean him from his absorption in Greek literature, his
wife at first urged him to take up some fresh literary work;
and finally, becoming seriously alarmed for his health, induced
him to go eastward for a koumýs cure. He wrote to
Fet at this time:</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>10 June 1871.</i></p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have long not written to you, nor been to
see you, because I was, and still am, ill. I don't myself know
what is the matter with me, but it seems like something bad or
good, according to the name we give to our exit. Loss of
strength, and a feeling that one needs nothing and wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
nothing but quiet, which one has not got. My wife is sending
me to Samára or Sarátof for two months for a koumýs cure.
I leave for Moscow to-day, and shall there learn where I am to
go to.</p>

<p>In Moscow it was decided that he should go to the part
of Samára he had visited before.</p>

<p>Railways have always been an affliction to Tolstoy.
Civilisation has forced them on him without his wish, and,
as he argued in his educational articles, to the detriment of
the peasant population. Personally, he complained of disagreeable
sensations he experienced when travelling by rail,
and compared these discomforts with the pleasure of riding
on horseback. He objected both to the officious politeness of
the conductors and to the way in which the passengers suspiciously
shun one another. (This latter complaint is not one
a Westerner would bring against Russians, for they appear
to us the most friendly and sociable of fellow-travellers.)
He used to insist on his wife always travelling first class.
He himself went either first or third, but seldom second.
To travel third is a more serious matter in Russia than in
England; and he used purposely to choose a car in which
there were peasants, and talked to all whom he met.</p>

<p>On this outward journey he went third class, by rail to
Nízhni Nóvgorod and by steamer down the Vólga to the
town of Samára. On the boat he took the opportunity to
study the manners and customs of his fellow-passengers,
natives of the Vólga district, and displayed his remarkable
gift of making friends with people of all kinds. Before
he had been two days on the boat he was on the friendliest
terms with everybody, including the sailors, among whom
he slept each night in the fore part of the vessel. Even
when he met reserved or surly characters, it was not long
before he drew them out of their shells, and set them
chatting at their ease. One secret of this success was the
unaffected interest he took in learning about other people's
lives and affairs.</p>

<p>From Samára Tolstoy went eastward for eighty miles on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
horseback, following the banks of the river Karalýk till he
reached the village of that name. He had lived there
in 1862, and was welcomed as an old acquaintance and
friend by the Bashkírs, who always spoke of him as 'The
Count.' The reader will remember that at the University
Tolstoy had studied oriental languages. His knowledge of
Tartar no doubt increased his popularity with the Bashkírs.
He had with him a man-servant, and his brother-in-law,
Stepán Andréyevitch Behrs, then a lad of about sixteen,
who subsequently in his <i>Recollections</i> gave many particulars
about this outing. They lived, not in the 'winter
village' of Karalýk, but about one-and-a-half miles away, in
a <i>kotchévka</i> on the open steppe. A <i>kotchévka</i> is a conical
tent, made of a collapsible wooden frame covered with
large sheets of felt. It has a small painted door, and is
usually carpeted with soft feather grass. The one in which
Tolstoy's party lived, was a very large one which he hired
from the Mullah (priest). It had formerly been used as a
mosque, but had the practical disadvantage of not being
rain-proof. There were four <i>kotchévki</i> in the neighbourhood,
one of which was occupied by the Mullah.</p>

<p>On first arriving at Karalýk, Tolstoy for some days felt
very depressed and unwell. He complained that he lacked
capacity to feel either mental or physical pleasure, and
looked at everything 'as though he were a corpse': a characteristic
usually most foreign to him, and which in other
people always evoked his dislike. It was, however, not long
before he recovered his spirits and energy.</p>

<p>There were other visitors at Karalýk, who had also come
to benefit by a koumýs cure. They neither associated with
the Bashkír nomads, nor adopted their customs; but Tolstoy
was extremely fond of the Bashkírs, associated much with
them, and strictly followed their diet: avoiding all vegetable
foods and restricting himself to meat and animal products.
Dinner every day consisted chiefly of mutton eaten with
the fingers out of wooden bowls.</p>

<p>Some of the Russian visitors lived in one of the <i>kotchévki</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
but most of them lodged in the 'winter village.' Tolstoy
soon made friends with them all, and thanks to his genial
influence the whole place grew gay and lively. A professor of
Greek from a Seminary for the education of priests might be
seen trying a skipping-rope match with him; a procureur's
assistant discussed legal and other questions, and there was
a young Samára farmer who became his devoted follower.</p>

<p>Among those who specially interested Tolstoy was
Mouhamet-Dzhan, the Bashkír Elder, whom the Russian
peasants called Michael Ivánovitch. This man was very
nimble and active, full of humour, fond of a joke, and a
very strong player at draughts.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Behrs and two of their new acquaintances,
and taking a supply of guns and presents, Tolstoy
went for a four days' drive through the neighbouring villages.
The party had splendid duck-shooting by the lakes they
passed; and they were entertained and treated to koumýs
by the Bashkírs at the <i>kotchévkas</i> in which they rested. As
opportunity presented itself, they made suitable acknowledgment
for their entertainment by giving presents to
their hosts. One serious drawback to the hospitality they
enjoyed was the fact that their hosts insisted on feeding
them with mutton and fat with their own hands, without
the intermediacy of fork or spoon, and it was out of the
question to insult them by refusing such well-meant though
quite undesired attentions.</p>

<p>On one occasion Tolstoy happened to admire a horse that
had separated from its herd, and remarked to Behrs, 'See
what a beautiful specimen of milking mare that is.' When,
an hour later, they were taking leave, their host tied this
animal to their conveyance, thus presenting it to his visitor.
Of course, on the return journey, Tolstoy had to make an
equivalent present in return.</p>

<p>Another incident of this stay in the Government of
Samára, was a visit to the Petróvsky Fair, which is held once
a year at Bouzouloúk, a small town some fifty miles from
Karalýk. Here Russians, Bashkírs, Oural Cossacks, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Kirghiz mingled with one another; and Tolstoy was soon on
a friendly footing with them all. He would chat and laugh
with them even when they were drunk; but when one in
that condition took it into his head to embrace the Count,
Tolstoy's look was so stern and impressive that the fellow
drew back his hands and let them fall, saying, 'No, never
mind, it's all right!'</p>

<p>The following letter of 18th July 1871, to Fet, relates to
Tolstoy's experience of the nomadic Bashkírs:</p>

<p class="i2">Thank you for your letter, dear friend! It seems that my
wife gave a false alarm when she packed me off for a koumýs
cure and persuaded me that I was ill. At any rate now, after
four weeks, I seem to have quite recovered. And as is proper
when one is taking a koumýs cure, I am drunk and sweat from
morn to night, and find pleasure in it. It is very good here,
and were it not for family home-sickness, I should be quite
happy. Were I to begin describing, I should fill a hundred
pages with this country and my own occupations. I am reading
Herodotus, who describes in detail and with great accuracy
these same galactophagous [gluttonous-for-milk] Scythians
among whom I am living.</p>

<p class="i2">I began this letter yesterday, and wrote that I was well.
To-day my side aches again. I do not myself know in how far
I am ill, but it is bad that I am obliged to think&mdash;and cannot
help thinking&mdash;about my side and my chest. This is the third
day that the heat has been terrible. In the <i>kibítka</i> [tent] it is as
hot as on the shelf of a Russian bath, but I like it. The country
here is beautiful&mdash;in its age just emerging from virginity, in its
richness, its health, and especially in its simplicity and its unperverted
population. Here as everywhere I am looking round
for an estate to buy. This affords me an occupation, and is the
best excuse for getting to know the real condition of the district.</p>

<p>After a six weeks' stay Tolstoy returned to Yásnaya,
travelling first class on the return journey.</p>

<p>His search for an estate had been successful, and after
persuading his wife that the investment was a sound one,
he purchased two thousand acres on his return to Moscow.</p>

<p>The change of scene, or some other influence, weakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Tolstoy's absorption in Greek literature; and a huge dictionary
he had taken with him, was used by his brother-in-law
to press a collection of local wildflowers.</p>

<p>During his wanderings on the steppe, Tolstoy met many
Molokáns, members of a kind of Bible-Christian peasant
sect. They base their faith on the Bible, reject the Greek
Church with its traditions, priesthood, dogmas, ritual,
sacraments, and icons. The name Molokán, or Milk-Drinker,
probably arose from the fact that, not observing
the Russian fasts, these people do not scruple to drink milk
in Lent. They are said to be distinguished by an honesty
and industry not found among their Orthodox neighbours;
and they abstain from all intoxicants.</p>

<p>It interested Tolstoy to mix with these people, and he
liked to discuss their beliefs, especially with a venerable
leader of theirs, named Aggéy. It so happened that in
the neighbouring village of Pátrovka there was a very
worthy young Russian priest, who was eager to convert the
Molokáns, and occasionally arranged debates with them
on religious subjects. Tolstoy sometimes attended these
debates: his object being not so much to convert the
Molokáns, as to understand the points on which they
differed from the Russo-Greek Church. He also took an
interest in the Mohammedan faith of his Bashkír friends,
and on his return to Yásnaya read through a French translation
of the Koran.</p>

<p>A few years later Tolstoy associated much with the
representatives of various sects and faiths, being then
profoundly interested in their beliefs; but at this time,
his interest in such matters was only beginning to make
itself felt.</p>

<p>A letter of Tourgénef's written at this period, indicates
how little he allowed his quarrel with Tolstoy the man, to
warp his appreciation of Tolstoy the artist. Writing to
Fet on 2nd July 1871, he says:</p>

<p class="i2">Your letter again grieves me&mdash;I refer to what you write
about L. Tolstoy. I have great fears on his account, for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of his brothers died of consumption, and I am very glad he is
taking a koumýs cure, in the reality and efficacy of which I
have faith. L. Tolstoy is the only hope of our orphaned literature;
he cannot and must not vanish from the face of the earth
as prematurely as his predecessors: Poúshkin, Lérmontof and
Gógol.</p>

<p>Again in November, writing from Paris, he says:</p>

<p class="i2">I am very glad that Tolstoy's health is now satisfactory and
that he is at work. Whatever he does will be good, if only he
does not himself mutilate his own handiwork. Philosophy,
which he hates, has revenged herself on him in a strange way:
she has infected him, and the enemy of rationalising has
plunged head over ears into rationalisation! But perhaps all
<i>that</i> has fallen away from him by now, and left only the pure
and powerful artist.</p>

<p>On returning home from Samára improved in health,
Tolstoy turned his thoughts once more to matters educational:
especially to the crying want of good primers for
those beginning to read. We have seen how strongly, in
1862, he had felt the need of well-written books simple
enough for beginners and peasant readers, and how he
resented the monopolisation of knowledge by the cultured
classes entrenched behind barriers of pedantry. We have
seen, too, how under the influence of Homer he swore he
would no more write 'wordy rubbish'; and the time had
now come for this feeling to bear fruit. The task to which
he devoted his powers at their zenith, was the production
of an <i>ABC</i> Book for beginners, which was to be as
simple, sincere and perfect in form and in subject-matter
as possible.</p>

<p>We know from the writings of the American Consul, Mr.
Eugene Schuyler, who visited Tolstoy in 1868, and at his
request obtained for him a collection of American school
primers, that Tolstoy was even then meditating a work of
the kind to which he now devoted himself ardently for
a whole year. By September he was hard at work, the
Countess as usual acting as his amanuensis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Of her we hear that in an impulsive, kind-hearted way, she
often rendered assistance to the poor, not merely among the
Yásnaya Polyána peasants, but to others from a distance as
well; and that the neighbouring peasants thought well of
her.</p>

<p>The increase in the Tolstoy family was met this year by
a considerable enlargement of their domicile. By way of a
house-warming to celebrate the completion of the building,
a masquerade was arranged at Christmas, at which Tolstoy
evoked great enthusiasm by appearing as a goat.</p>

<p>About this time, at the age of sixteen, Behrs and a school
friend of his became sorely troubled as to the state of their
souls, and thought of entering a monastery. This is what
he tells us of Tolstoy's relation to the matter:</p>

<p class="i2">His attitude towards my inclination was a most cautious one.
I often went to him with my doubts and questions, but he
always managed to avoid expressing his opinion, knowing how
very great an influence it would have with me. He left it to
me to work out my own convictions. Once, however, he spoke
out with sufficient plainness. We were riding past the village
church where his parents lie buried. Two horses were grazing
in the churchyard. We had been talking over the only subject
that then interested me.</p>

<p class="i2">'How can a man live in peace,' I asked, 'so long as he has
not solved the question of a future life?'</p>

<p class="i2">'You see those two horses grazing there,' he answered; 'are
they not laying up for a future life?'</p>

<p class="i2">'But I am speaking of our spiritual, not our earthly life.'</p>

<p class="i2">'Indeed? Well, about that, I neither know nor can know
anything.'</p>


<h3>1872</h3>

<p>Immediately after New Year he re-started his school; and
the children (who often numbered thirty to thirty-five) met,
not as formerly in another building, but in the hall
of the Tolstoys' enlarged house. In the mornings the
Countess taught her own children, and in the afternoon she,
her husband, and even seven-year-old Tánya and eight-year-old
Sergius, taught the peasant children, who came only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
then, but yet made satisfactory progress, being stimulated
by the personal interest the Tolstoys took in them, by the
pedagogic genius of the Count, and by a perception that
education is a rare and valuable luxury, which seldom comes
within the reach of Russian peasants.</p>

<p>In the <i>ABC</i> Book Tolstoy gives several autobiographical
stories of how he learned to ride, and of his dogs Milton
and Boúlka. Easy as these are, they are admirably written,
and combine brevity and simplicity with sincerity; though
their sincerity lies not in telling the facts just as they
occurred, but in the truth of the feeling conveyed to the
reader. Besides these and other stories, popular historical
sketches, and a number of translations and adaptations
from <i>Esop's Fables</i> and from Indian, Hebrew and Arabic
sources, the work contains some popular ballads or folk-stories
in verse. To get these poems as perfect as possible,
he studied and collated all the versions of them he could
collect.</p>

<p>The section on Arithmetic gave him an immense amount
of work, for he would not content himself with the usual
explanations of the various operations, but devised explanations
of his own.</p>

<p>The book contains some elementary natural science, and
for the preparation of this, Tolstoy, besides examining all
sorts of text-books, consulted specialists on the various
subjects, and himself carefully performed most of the
experiments he described.</p>

<p>To select the readings in the Church-Slavonic language,
he perused the monkish chronicles and the Lives of the
Saints.</p>

<p>Intending to include some readings on astronomy, he
took up that study himself, and became so interested in it
that he sometimes sat up all night examining the stars.</p>

<p>When the news spread that Tolstoy was writing stories
for his <i>ABC</i> Book, the magazine editors besieged him with
demands, and the first bits of the book to see the light were
<i>A Prisoner in the Caucasus</i>, which appeared in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
monthlies in February, and <i>God Sees the Truth</i>, which came
out in another monthly in March.</p>

<p>Owing to some mismanagement, Tolstoy received nothing
for the periodical rights of either of these stories, which in
<i>What is Art?</i> he names as the best of all his works. They
(as well as <i>The Bear Hunt</i>, also from the <i>ABC</i> Book) are
given in English in <i>Twenty-three Tales</i>, previously referred
to. In rendering them, I did my best to retain the brief
simplicity of the originals; but where Russian customs were
alluded to, some of that simplicity was inevitably lost.</p>

<p>With what pleasure Tolstoy looks back to this part of his
life's work, was indicated by a remark he made to me in 1902.
Speaking of the popularity of <i>A Prisoner in the Caucasus</i>
for public readings to the peasants, he added with evident
satisfaction, that when <i>A Prisoner in the Caucasus</i> is now
mentioned, it is always taken for granted that it is his little
story, and not Poúshkin's famous poem of the same name,
that is referred to.</p>

<p>Since their first appearance, these two stories have sold
by hundreds of thousands in separate editions at three to
ten copecks (about a penny or twopence) each, besides
appearing in the <i>Readers</i> and among Tolstoy's collected
works.</p>

<p>In the following letter to Fet we get a vivid glimpse of
the thoughts on life's deepest problems, which were before
long to fill Tolstoy's mind completely.</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>30 Jan. 1872.</i></p>

<p class="i2">It is some days since I received your kind but sad letter, and
not till to-day do I settle down to answer it.</p>

<p class="i2">It is a sad letter, for you write that Tútchef is dying, and
that there is a rumour that Tourgénef is dead; and about yourself
you say the machine is wearing out and you want quietly
to think of Nirvana. Please let me know quickly whether this
is a false alarm. I hope it is, and that, in the absence of Márya
Petróvna, you have taken slight symptoms for a return of your
terrible illness.</p>

<p class="i2">In Nirvana there is nothing to laugh at; still less is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
cause for anger. We all (I, at least) feel that it is much more
interesting than life; but I agree that however much I may
think about it, I can think of nothing else than that Nirvana is
nothingness. I only stand up for one thing: religious reverence&mdash;awe
of that Nirvana.</p>

<p class="i2">There is, at any rate, nothing more important than it.</p>

<p class="i2">What do I mean by religious reverence? I mean this: I
lately went to see my brother, and a child of his had died and
was being buried. The priests were there, and a small pink
coffin, and everything as it should be. My brother and I involuntarily
confessed to one another that we felt something
like repulsion towards ceremonial rites. But afterwards I
thought, 'Well, but what should my brother do to remove the
putrefying body of the child from the house? How is one to
finish the matter decently?' There is no better way (at least, I
could devise none) than to do it with a requiem and incense.
How is it to be when we grow weak and die? Is nature to
take her course, are we to ... and nothing else? That would
not be well. One wishes fully to express the gravity and importance,
the solemnity and religious awe of that occurrence,
the most important in every man's life. And I also can devise
nothing more seemly for people of all ages and all degrees of
development, than a religious observance. For me at least
those Slavonic words evoke quite the same metaphysical ecstasy
as one experiences when one thinks of Nirvana. Religion is
wonderful, in that she has for so many ages rendered to so
many millions of people these same services&mdash;the greatest anything
human can render in this matter. With such a task, how
can she be logical? Yes&mdash;there is something in her. Only to
you do I allow myself to write such letters; but I wished to
write, and I feel sad, especially after your letter.
Please write soon about your health.&mdash;Your</p>

<p class="rightm smcap">Leo Tolstoy.</p>

<p class="i2">I am terribly dispirited. The work I have begun is fearfully
hard, there is no end to the preparatory study necessary. The
plan of the work is ever increasing, and my strength, I feel,
grows less and less. One day I am well, and three days I
am ill.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
The work here referred to as 'fearfully hard' was a study
of the reign of Peter the Great, in preparation for a novel
treating of that period.</p>

<p>On 20th February he again wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I may not correspond with my friends for years at a time,
but when my friend is in trouble, it is terribly shameful and
painful not to know of it.... Now, being in Moscow, I
wished to call on the Bótkins to hear about you, but I fell ill
myself, took to my bed, and it was all I could do to get home.
Now I am better. At home all is well; but you will not
recognise our house: we have been using the new extension
all winter. Another novelty is that I have again started a
school. My wife and children and I all teach and are all
contented. I have finished my <i>ABC</i> Book and am printing
it....</p>

<p>The next letter shows that his hope that he had finished
the <i>ABC</i> Book was premature:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><i>16 March 1872.</i></p>

<p class="i2">How I wish to see you; but I cannot come, I am still ill....
My <i>ABC</i> Book gives me no peace for any other occupation.
The printing advances on the feet of a tortoise, and the
deuce knows when it will be finished, and I am still adding and
omitting and altering. What will come of it I know not;
but I have put my whole soul into it.</p>

<p>In May 1872 the Countess gave birth to another boy,
who was christened Peter.</p>

<p>The Moscow firm who were printing the book for Tolstoy
were not able to give him satisfaction. Not only was the
printing a matter of difficulty owing to the variety of type
required for a school-book of this kind, but Tolstoy, in
accord with his invariable practice, revised the work time
after time while it was going through the press. At last, in
May, he wrote to his trusty friend and admirer, N. Stráhof,
saying that after four months' labour the printing was
'not only not finished, but had not even begun,' and begging
Stráhof to have the book printed in Petersburg, and to take
on himself for ample payment the whole task of revising the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
proofs. After some correspondence matters were arranged,
though Stráhof declined to accept any payment for the help
he rendered.</p>

<p>Tolstoy explained to his friend that he wanted to make a
profit on the book if possible. As a rule, all Tolstoy's later
teaching seems to grow out of his experience of life; but
it would be hard for any one to work more conscientiously
than Tolstoy laboured over this book, and yet in later life
he speaks as though any admixture of mercenary motives is
sure to be fatal to good literary work. We here seem, therefore,
to come upon an exception to that rule.</p>

<p>Stráhof's assistance enabled Tolstoy (though he continued
to give most careful instructions with regard to the treatment
of the various sections of the book) to get a much
needed change; and after having as usual worked during
the winter and spring up to the very limit of his strength,
he went for a short visit to his Samára estate, where
he arranged about building, and about breaking up the
virgin soil. A peasant from Yásnaya village was appointed
steward of the new estate, and was instructed to see to the
building of the house there. Being far away from home
Tolstoy was anxious about his <i>ABC</i> Book; so he cut
short his stay, and returned to Yásnaya before the end of
July. There he learned that a fine young bull of his had
gored its keeper to death. The unpleasantness of such an
occurrence and of the legal investigation consequent on the
man's death, was greatly increased by the fact that the
Investigating Magistrate, an incompetent and arrogant young
official, wrongly held Tolstoy responsible for 'careless holding
of cattle,' and, besides commencing criminal proceedings
against him, obliged him to give a written undertaking
not to leave Yásnaya. Prince D. D. Obolénsky tells how
Tolstoy arrived one day at a meet at the Prince's estate of
Schahovskóy (some thirty miles from Yásnaya) late and
much upset, and told of an examination he had that morning
undergone at the hands of the Investigating Magistrate,
whose duties included those of Coroner. 'Being an excit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>able
man,' says Obolénsky, 'Tolstoy was extremely indignant
at the Magistrate's conduct, and told how the latter had kept
a Yásno-Polyána peasant in prison for a year-and-a-half on
suspicion of having stolen a cow, which then turned out to
have been stolen by some one else. "He will confine me
for a year," added Tolstoy. "It is absurd, and shows how
utterly arbitrary these gentlemen are. I shall sell all I
have in Russia and go to England, where every man's
person is respected. Here every police-officer, if one does
not grovel at his feet, can play one the dirtiest tricks!"'</p>

<p>P. F. Samárin, who had also come to the hunt, opposed
Tolstoy with animation, arguing that the death or even
the mutilation of a man, was so serious a matter that it
could not be left without judicial investigation. After long
argument Samárin more or less convinced Tolstoy, and the
latter before retiring to rest remarked to Obolénsky, 'What
a wonderful power of calming people Samárin has!'</p>

<p>The judicial proceedings dragged on for more than a
month, and it was not till late in September that Tolstoy
was again free to take a journey to Moscow. The proceedings,
first against him and then against his steward,
were abandoned; but not before the newspapers had taken
the matter up and made a fuss about it.</p>

<p>At last, in November, the <i>ABC</i> Book was published. It
sold slowly, and was attacked by some of the papers. Tolstoy
however was not discouraged, but held to his belief that
(as he expressed it to Stráhof) he had 'erected a monument'&mdash;a
conviction amply justified by the ultimate success of the
work. He had indeed produced a reading-book far superior
to anything that had previously existed in Russia, and that
is probably unmatched in any language. With certain
modifications to be mentioned later on, it continues to
circulate throughout Russia to the present day.</p>

<p>In connection with his other efforts to popularise his
system of instruction, Tolstoy, in October 1872, invited
a dozen teachers from neighbouring schools to visit him for
a week at Yásnaya. They were accommodated in his second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
house (called, as is customary in Russian when speaking
of a subsidiary residence, 'the wing'); and a number of
illiterate boys were collected from villages within reach,
to be taught on Tolstoy's lines. He also formed a project
of establishing a 'University in bark shoes' [the country
peasants wear bark shoes] or in other words, a training college
in which peasants could become teachers without ceasing
to be peasants. This plan occupied his attention, off
and on, for some years; but (owing to causes which will be
related later) never came to fruition.</p>

<p>In December Tourgénef writes from Paris, to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I got a copy of L. Tolstoy's ABC, but except the beautiful
story, <i>A Prisoner in the Caucasus</i>, I did not find anything interesting
in it. And the price is absurdly dear for a work of
that kind.</p>

<p>The price of the first edition of 3000 copies of the <i>ABC</i>
was Rs. 2 (about 5s. 6d.). Tourgénef probably had no idea
of the immense labour, or of the typographical difficulties,
involved in its production. The subsequent editions were
much cheaper.</p>

<p>About this time Fet sent Tolstoy a letter in rhyme, to
which the latter replied as follows:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><i>12 November 1872.</i></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The causeless shame felt by the onion</div>
<div class="line i2">Before the sweetly-scented rose,</div>
<div class="line">My dearest Fet, I should be feeling,</div>
<div class="line i2">Were I to answer you in prose.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">And yet in maiden verse replying,</div>
<div class="line i2">By sad misgivings I'm beset:</div>

<div class="line i2">Yet still I shall not feel upset</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>Too apt we often are to worry;</div>
<div class="line i2">O'er future ills let us not fret:</div>
<div class="line">Sufficient for the day, its evil&mdash;</div>
<div class="line i2">It's best to think so, dearest Fet!</div>
</div></div></div>


<p class="i2">Joking apart, write quickly and let me know when to send
horses to the station to meet you. I want to see you terribly.</p>

<p class="p2">Having at last got his <i>ABC</i> off his hands, Tolstoy resumed
his preliminary labours for a large novel, which was
to deal with the period of Peter the Great. On 19th November
1872 the Countess wrote to her brother:</p>

<p class="i2">Our life just now is very, very serious. All day we are
occupied. Leo sits surrounded by a pile of portraits, pictures
and books, engrossed in reading, marking passages and taking
notes. In the evening, when the children have gone to bed,
he tells me his plans, and what he means to write. At times
he is quite discouraged, falls into despair, and thinks nothing
will ever come of it. At other times he is on the point of
setting ardently to work; but as yet I cannot say he has actually
written anything, he is still preparing.</p>

<p>A month later she wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">As usual we are all of us very busy. The winter is the working
time for us proprietors, just as much as summer is for the
peasants. Leo is still reading historical books of the time of
Peter the Great, and is much interested in them. He notes
down the characters of various people, their traits, as well as the
way of life of the boyars and the peasants, and Peter's activity.
He does not yet know what will come of it all, but it seems
to me we shall have another prose poem like <i>War and Peace</i>;
but of the time of Peter the Great.</p>


<h3>1873</h3>

<p>A few months later he definitely abandoned the project.
His opinion of Peter the Great ran directly counter to
the popular one, and he felt out of sympathy with the whole
epoch. He declared there was nothing great about
the personality or activity of Peter, whose qualities
were all bad. His so-called reforms, far from aiming at the
welfare of the people, aimed simply at his own personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
advantage. He founded Petersburg because the boyars,
who were influential and consequently dangerous to him,
disapproved of the changes he made, and because he wished
to be free to follow an immoral mode of life. The changes
and reforms he introduced were borrowed from Saxony,
where the laws were most cruel, and the morals most
dissolute&mdash;all of which particularly pleased him. This,
Tolstoy holds, explains Peter's friendship with the Elector
of Saxony, who was among the most immoral of rulers.
He also considers that Peter's intimacy with the pieman
Ménshikof and with the Swiss deserter Lefort, is explained
by the contempt in which Peter was held by
all the boyars, among whom he could not find men willing
to share his dissolute life. Most of all, Tolstoy was
revolted by the murder of Peter's son Alexis, in which
crime Tolstoy's own ancestor had played a very prominent
part.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the abandonment of the project
to which he had devoted so much time and attention,
Tolstoy, without any special preparation, began to write his
second great novel, <i>Anna Karénina</i>.</p>

<p>The year before, a lady named Anna who lived with
Bíbikof, a neighbouring squire mentioned on a previous
page, had committed suicide by throwing herself under
a train, out of jealousy of Bíbikof's attentions to their
governess. Tolstoy knew all the details of the affair, and
had been present at the post-mortem. This supplied him
with a theme; but it was not till March 1873, and then as
it were by accident, that he actually began to write the
book. One day a volume of Poúshkin happened to be lying
open at the commencement of <i>A Fragment</i>, which begins
with the words, 'The guests had arrived at the country
house.' Tolstoy, noticing this, remarked to those present
that these words, plunging at once into the midst of things,
are a model of how a story should begin. Some one then
laughingly suggested that he should begin a novel in that
way; and Tolstoy at once started on <i>Anna Karénina</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
second sentence, and first narrative sentence, of which is,
'All was in confusion in the Oblónskys' house.'</p>

<p>In May Tolstoy and his whole family went for a three
months' visit to Samára, where he had recently purchased
some more land.</p>

<p>This summer he hired a Bashkír named Mouhamed Shah,
who owned and brought with him a herd of milking mares.
This Mouhamed Shah, or Románovitch as he was called in
Russian, was polite, punctual, and dignified. He had a
workman to drive the herd, and a wife (who retired behind
a curtain in his <i>kotchévka</i> when visitors came to see him) to
wait upon him. In subsequent years this worthy man
repeatedly resumed his engagement with the Tolstoys.</p>

<p>This was the first year the whole estate had been ploughed
up and sown. It was fortunate for the district that some
one who had the ear of the public, happened to be there;
for the crops in the whole neighbourhood failed utterly, and
a famine ensued. So out-of-the-world were the people and
so cut off from civilisation, that they might have suffered
and died without the rest of Russia hearing anything about
it, had not Tolstoy been at hand to make their plight known
in good time by an appeal for help, which the Countess
prompted him to draw up, and which appeared on 17th
August, in Katkóf's paper, the <i>Moscow Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>In this article on the Samára Famine, Tolstoy describes
how the complete failure of the harvest, following as it did
on two previous poor harvests, had brought nearly nine-tenths
of the population to destitution and hunger.</p>

<p>To ascertain the real state of things Tolstoy took an
inventory at every tenth house in the village of Gavrílovka&mdash;the
one nearest his estate; and of the twenty-three
families so examined, all but one were found to be in
debt, and none of them knew how they were to get
through the winter. Most of the men had left home to
look for work, but the harvest being bad everywhere, and
so many people being in search of work, the price of labour
had fallen to one-eighth of what it had previously been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Tolstoy visited several villages and found a similar
state of things everywhere. Together with his article,
he sent Rs. 100 (then equal to about £14) as a first subscription
to a Famine Fund. This was only a small part
of what he spent in relief of the impoverished peasants,
for when Prougávin (well known for his valuable descriptions
of Russian sects) visited the district in 1881, many
of the inhabitants spoke to him of Tolstoy's personal
kindness to the afflicted, and of his gifts of corn and money
during the famine.</p>

<p>The subscription proved a success. Tolstoy's aunt, the
Countess A. A. Tolstoy (who had charge of the education of
Marie Alexándrovna, subsequently Duchess of Edinburgh),
mentioned the matter to the Empress, who was one of the first
to contribute. Her example was largely followed, and altogether,
in money and in kind, something like Rs. 2,000,000,
or about £270,000, was contributed during 1873-4. Within
a year or two, good harvests again completely changed the
whole appearance of the district.</p>

<p>This was the first, but neither the last nor the worst, of
the famines in which Tolstoy rendered help.</p>

<p>Before the end of August 1873 he was back at Yásnaya,
and wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">On the 22nd we arrived safely from Samára.... In spite of
the drought, the losses and the inconvenience, we all, even my
wife, are satisfied with our visit, and yet more satisfied to be
back in the old frame of our life; and we are now taking up
our respective labours....</p>

<p>A month later he writes again, referring to Kramskóy's
portrait of himself, a photogravure of which forms the
frontispiece of this volume, and shows the blouse which even
in those days, before his Conversion, he wore when at home,
instead of a tailor-made coat:</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>25 September 1873.</i></p>

<p class="i2">I am beginning to write.... The children are learning; my
wife is busy and teaches. Every day for a week Kramskóy has
been painting my portrait for Tretyakóf's Gallery, and I sit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
chat with him, and try to convert him from the Petersburg
faith to the faith of the baptized. I agreed to this, because
Kramskóy came personally, and offered to paint a second
portrait for us very cheaply, and because my wife persuaded
me.</p>

<p>Up to this time Tolstoy, sensitive about his personal
appearance, and instinctively disliking any personal advertisement,
had always had an objection to having his portrait
painted; and if he ever allowed himself to be photographed,
was careful to have the negative destroyed that copies might
not be multiplied. This prejudice he abandoned in later
life; and after Kramskóy had broken the ice, portraits and
photographs of Tolstoy became more and more common.</p>

<p>Kramskóy's acquaintance with the Tolstoys came about
in this way. He was commissioned to paint a portrait of
the great novelist, for the collection of famous Russians in
Tretyakóf's picture gallery in Moscow; but sought in vain
in that town for his photograph, and was too modest to ask
Tolstoy (who, he knew, was living a secluded life at Yásnaya)
to give him sittings. He therefore hired a <i>dátcha</i>,
some three miles from Yásnaya, with the intention of
painting Tolstoy, who often rode past on horseback. His
intention, however, became known, and the Tolstoys at
once sent him a friendly invitation to visit them. Of the
two very similar portraits of Tolstoy which Kramskóy
painted, one has remained at Yásnaya.</p>

<p>Before Tolstoy's next letter to Fet, the angel of death
had crossed the threshold of his house for the first time in
his married life. On 11th November he wrote:</p>

<p class="i2">We are in trouble: Peter, our youngest, fell ill with croup
and died in two days. It is the first death in our family in
eleven years, and my wife feels it very deeply. One may
console oneself by saying that if one had to choose one of our
eight, this loss is lighter than any other would have been; but
the heart, especially the mother's heart&mdash;that wonderful and
highest manifestation of Divinity on earth&mdash;does not reason,
and my wife grieves.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>


<h3>1874</h3>

<p>During the whole of 1874 Tolstoy made strenuous efforts
to get his system of education more generally adopted. On
15th January, overcoming his dislike of speaking in
public, he addressed the Moscow Society of Literacy
on the subject of the best way to teach children to read.
The details of his argument need not here detain us, as it
will fall to the lot of few of my readers to teach Russian
children to read Russian; but briefly, the German <i>Lautiermethode</i>
had been adopted by Russian pedagogues in a
way that Tolstoy considered arbitrary and pedantic, and his
appeal, which in the main has not carried conviction to the
educationalists, was against that method.</p>

<p>The large hall in which the meeting took place was
crowded. The President of the Society, Mr. Shatílof,
invited Tolstoy to open the debate, but Tolstoy preferred
to reply to what questions and remarks the other speakers
might put. In the course of the animated proceedings,
in which several men well known in the Russian educational
world took part, the discussion widened out till it
covered the question of the whole direction of elementary
education; and Tolstoy, from the standpoint of his belief
that it is harmful to force upon the people a culture they
do not demand and are not prepared for&mdash;and much of
which, though considered by us to be science, may yet turn
out to be no better than the alchemy and astrology of the
Middle Ages&mdash;denounced the education forced upon the
children in elementary schools, and declared that this should
be confined in the first place to teaching the Russian language
and arithmetic, leaving natural science and history
alone. To prove the advantage of his way of teaching
reading, Tolstoy offered to give a practical demonstration
in one of the schools attached to some of the Moscow mills.
Accordingly it was arranged that this should take place
the next day and the day after, at the mills owned by Mr.
Ganéshin, on the Devítche Pólye just outside Moscow. On
the morrow Tolstoy was unwell, and did not appear; but he
gave his demonstration on the evening of the following day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
with the result that, on the suggestion of Mr. Shatílof, the
Society of Literacy decided to start two temporary schools
for the express purpose of testing the rival methods during
a period of seven weeks. The one school was taught by
Mr. M. E. Protopópof, an expert in the <i>Lautiermethode</i>,
while in the other school Tolstoy's method was taught by
Mr. P. V. Morózof. After seven weeks the children were
examined by a Committee, which had to report to the
Society at a meeting held on 13th April. The members of
the Committee however could not agree, and handed in
separate and contradictory reports. At the meeting of the
Society there was again a great divergence of opinion; and
Tolstoy, who considered that the test had not been made
under proper conditions (most of the pupils being too young,
and the continual presence of visitors preventing the teacher
from holding the children's attention), but that nevertheless
his method had shown its superiority, decided to appeal to
a wider public, and did so in the form of a letter addressed
to Mr. Shatílof.</p>

<p>A full account of what happened from the time the
dispute passed into the press, has been given by that powerful
and popular critic and essayest, N. K. Mihaylóvsky,
who was at this time a colleague of Nekrásof. In 1866 the
<i>Contemporary</i> had been prohibited, as a punishment for its
too Liberal tendencies. In 1868 Nekrásof and Saltykóf
(Stchedrín) had taken over the management of the <i>Fatherland
Journal</i>. Tolstoy, who had long dropped out of touch
with Nekrásof, now addressed to him a request that the
<i>Fatherland Journal</i> should take a hand in his fight with the
pedagogic specialists, and should interest a wider public in
his educational reforms. As an inducement, he held out a
prospect (never fulfilled) that he would contribute some of
his works of fiction to their magazine. The outcome of his
correspondence with Nekrásof was, that though the whole
question of elementary education was somewhat foreign to
a literary magazine such as the <i>Fatherland Journal</i>, a long
article by Tolstoy (his letter to Shatílof) appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
September number, under the title of <i>On the Education of
the People</i>.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's educational articles in 1862, when he issued
them in his own magazine, had fallen quite flat and
attracted no attention, but this article, by the author of
<i>War and Peace</i>, in a leading Petersburg magazine, though
expressing very similar views, received very much attention,
and was criticised, favourably or adversely, in a large number
of other publications. Though his views were only adopted
to a small extent, yet the severe shock which he administered
to the professional pedagogues who looked on school-children
as 'a flock existing for the sake of its shepherds,' had
a most healthy influence, and that it did not pass without
some immediate practical effect is indicated by the rejection
from the Moscow Teachers' Seminary of one of the text-books
Tolstoy attacked most fiercely.</p>

<p>Following on the storm raised in the press by Tolstoy's
article, Mihaylóvsky, in the <i>Fatherland Journal</i> for January
1875, published a long article entitled <i>An Outsider's Notes</i>,
in which he took Tolstoy's part against the pedagogues,
and said: 'Though I am one of the profane in philosophy
and pedagogics, and am writing simply a <i>feuilleton</i>, I nevertheless
advise my readers to peruse this <i>feuilleton</i> with great
attention, not for my sake, but for Tolstoy's, and for the
sake of those fine shades of thought on which I do but
comment.'</p>

<p>Before this, however, Tolstoy had made another attempt
to improve the state of elementary education, by promoting
the establishment of that 'University in bark shoes' to
which I have already alluded.</p>

<p>He had found some of the boys in the Yásno-Polyána
school anxious to continue their studies after finishing the
school course; and an experiment in teaching these lads
algebra had been highly successful.</p>

<p>In his last article on Education, Tolstoy had pointed out
that a great obstacle to the spread of efficient elementary
instruction lay in the fact that the peasants could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
afford the salaries (extremely modest as these sound to
Western ears) demanded by Russian teachers of the non-peasant
classes. It was therefore quite natural that he
should now devise a scheme for preparing teachers from
among the peasants themselves; and he drew up a project
for a training college to be established at Yásnaya, under
his own direction and control.</p>

<p>In the summer of this year Tolstoy paid a brief visit to
his Samára estate to look after its management; and he
took his son Sergius with him.</p>

<p>On 20th November 1874 the Countess wrote to her
brother:</p>

<p class="i2">Our usual serious winter work is now in full swing. Leo
is quite taken up with popular education, schools, and colleges
for teachers, where teachers for the peasants' schools are to be
trained. All this keeps him busy from morning till night.
I have my doubts about all this. I am sorry his strength should
be spent on these things instead of on writing a novel; and I
don't know in how far it will be of use, since all this activity
will extend only to one small corner of Russia.</p>

<p>P. F. Samárin, the Marshal of the Nobility of Toúla
Government, backed Tolstoy cordially, and pointed out that
the Zémstvo (County Council) had a sum of Rs. 30,000
available for educational purposes, and that this might be
devoted to starting a teachers' Training College. To attain
this end Tolstoy, who heretofore had always refused to
stand for election, consented to enter the Zémstvo, and after
being returned to that body, was unanimously chosen to
serve on its Education Committee.</p>

<p>He presented a report in the sense indicated above, which
was at first favourably discussed; but unfortunately one of
the oldest members rose, and alluding to the fact that a
collection was being made all over Russia for a monument
to Catherine the Great, and that it was the centenary of the
decree by which she had created the Government of Toúla,
proposed that the money should be devoted to the monument
of their Benefactress. This loyal sentiment met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
approval, and though Tolstoy did not at once abandon his
plan, the means to carry it out were never forthcoming, and
we do not hear much more of it.</p>

<p>If one did not know how stupidly reactionary the governing
classes of Russia were at this period, it would seem
extraordinary that the central and the local authorities
alike should have so constantly balked and hindered Tolstoy's
disinterested projects: forbidding the publication of his
newspaper for soldiers, mutilating his stories, sending
gendarmes to search his schools, looking askance at his
school magazine, and defeating his project for a Training
College. Can it be wondered at, that he came more and
more to identify Government with all that is most opposed
to enlightenment? We know that similar causes were, at
that very time, driving men and women of a younger generation
to undertake dangerous propaganda work, in more
or less definite opposition to the existing order of society,
among factory workmen and country peasants.</p>

<p>His devotion to educational matters did not entirely
supersede, though no doubt it delayed, his activity as a
novelist. In the spring of 1874 he had taken the commencement
of <i>Anna Karénina</i> to Moscow, but for some
reason none of it appeared that year.</p>

<p>Tourgénef, in collaboration with Madame Viardot, was at
this time translating some of Tolstoy's best stories into
French. Writing to Fet in March 1874, he says:</p>

<p class="i2">The season is now almost over, but all the same I will try to
place his [Tolstoy's] <i>Three Deaths</i> in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
or in the <i>Temps</i>, and in autumn I will without fail get out
<i>The Cossacks</i>. The more often I read that story, the more
convinced I am that it is the <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> of Tolstoy and of all
Russian narrative literature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life and death pursued their course. In April
a son was born and christened Nicholas; and before long,
death, having a few months previously taken the youngest,
returned to claim the oldest members of the household.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
The first of them to go was his dearly-loved Aunty Tatiána
Alexándrovna, to whose good influence through life he owed
so much. She died on 20th June, and next year his other
aunt followed her.</p>

<p>Tolstoy never refers to his aunt Tatiána without letting
us see how he cherishes her memory. Here for instance are
one or two of his notes relating to her:</p>

<p class="i2">When already beginning to grow feeble, having waited her
opportunity, one day when I was in her room she said to us,
turning away (I saw that she was ready to cry), 'Look here,
<i>mes chers amis</i>, my room is a good one and you will want it. If
I die in it,' and her voice trembled, 'the recollection will be
unpleasant to you; so move me somewhere else, that I may
not die here.' Such she always was, from my earliest childhood,
before I was able to understand her goodness.</p>

<p>Again referring to her death, and to the love for his
father which had played so large a part in her life, he adds:</p>

<p class="i2">She died peacefully, gradually falling asleep; and died as
she desired, not in the room that had been hers, lest it should
be spoilt for us.</p>

<p class="i2">She died recognising hardly any one. But me she always
recognised, smiling and brightening up as an electric lamp does
when one touches the knob, and sometimes she moved her lips
trying to pronounce the name Nicholas: thus in death completely
and inseparably uniting me with him she had loved all
her life.</p>

<p>The opinion the peasants had of her, was shown by the
fact that when her coffin was carried through the village,
there was not one hut out of the sixty in Yásnaya Polyána,
from which the people did not come out asking to have the
procession stopped and a requiem sung for her soul. 'She
was a kind lady and did nobody any harm,' said they.
Tolstoy adds:</p>

<p class="i2">On that account they loved her, and loved her very much.
Lao-Tsze says things are valuable for what is not in them. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
it is with a life. It is most valuable if there is nothing bad in
it; and in the life of Tatiána Alexándrovna there was nothing
bad.</p>

<p>Except in the case of his brother Nicholas, Tolstoy has
usually not been greatly upset even by the deaths of those
near and dear to him. The following letter to Fet shows
how he took Tatiána's death:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><i>24 June 1874.</i></p>

<p class="i2">Two days ago we buried Aunt Tatiána Alexándrovna. She
died slowly and gradually, and I had grown accustomed to the
process; yet her death was, as the death of a near and dear
one always is, a quite new, isolated and unexpectedly-stirring
event. The others are well, and our house is full. The
delightful heat, the bathing and the fruit have brought me to
the state of mental laziness I love, with only enough mental
life remaining to enable me to remember my friends and think
of them.</p>

<p>The next letter, dated the 22nd October, tells its own tale:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch</span>,&mdash;I have planned to buy, and
must buy, some land at Nikólsky, and for that purpose must
borrow Rs. 10,000 for one year on mortgage. It may be that
you have money you want to place. If so, write to Iván
Ivánovitch Orlóf, Nikólsky village, and he will arrange the
affair with you independently of our relations to one another....
How gladly would I come to see you, were I not so overwhelmed
with the school, family and estate business, that I
have not even time to go out shooting.... I hope to be free
when winter comes.</p>


<h3>1875</h3>

<p>A small second edition of Tolstoy's <i>ABC</i> Book, in twelve
paper-bound parts, was printed this year; but he did not
yet feel quite satisfied with that work, and towards the close
of the year he revised it, abbreviating, omitting the arithmetic,
and introducing graduated reading exercises. As soon as
the pupil has mastered a few of the most necessary letters
and can put these together, Tolstoy contrives out of the
very simplest syllables to construct sentences that have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
meaning and an interest. The <i>New ABC</i> Book, apart from
the more advanced <i>Readers</i>, and consisting of ninety-two pages
of elementary matter, was issued in 1875, at the low
price of 14 copecks (about 4d.). Since Tolstoy's
efforts have seldom been favoured by the Government, it is
worth noting that this edition was 'Approved and recommended
by the Scholarly Committee of the Ministry of
Popular Education.' Between one and two million copies
of it have since been sold. The reading matter from his
first <i>ABC</i> Book was subsequently graded into four cheap
<i>Readers</i> costing 3d. to 4d. each, and though not honoured
by the Ministry of Education, they have from that time to
this circulated in increasing quantities, being printed of late
years in edition after edition of 50,000 at a time.</p>

<p>The Countess has in general enjoyed good health and
worn her years and the cares of her large family very lightly;
but during the winter of 1874-5 her condition gave her
husband much concern. In January he was able to write
to Fet: 'I have ceased to fear for my wife's health'; but
in fact for some time longer she continued to be ailing.</p>

<p>The commencement of <i>Anna Karénina</i>, appeared in the
first four monthly numbers of the <i>Russian Messenger</i> for
1875.</p>

<p>By far the best English version of that novel (as also of
<i>War and Peace</i>) is Mrs. Constance Garnett's, though I do
not like her alteration of the title of the book to <i>Anna
Karénin</i>, nor am I quite satisfied with her treatment of
some of the conversations in it; but unquestionably we have
much to thank her for.</p>

<p>In February the baby, Nicholas, died of inflammation of
the brain, and on 4th March 1875<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Tolstoy wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">We have one grief after another; you and Márya Petróvna
will certainly be sorry for us, especially for Sónya. Our
youngest son, ten months old, fell ill three weeks ago with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the dreadful illness called 'water on the brain,' and after three
weeks' terrible torture died three days ago, and we have buried
him to-day. I feel it hard through my wife; but for her, who
was nursing him herself, it is very hard.</p>

<p>In the same letter he mentions <i>Anna Karénina</i>, and immediately
afterwards he makes an allusion to the first idea
of his <i>Confession</i>, which was not actually written till 1879:</p>

<p class="i2">It pleases me very much that you praise <i>Karénina</i> and I hear
that she gets praised; but assuredly never was writer so indifferent
to his success as I am!</p>

<p class="i2">On the one hand what preoccupies me are the school affairs,
and on the other, strange to say, the subject of a new work,
which took possession of me just at the worst time of the boy's
illness,&mdash;and that illness itself and death....</p>

<p class="i2">From Tourgénef I have received the translation, printed in
the <i>Temps</i>, of my <i>Two Hussars</i>, and a letter written in the
third person asking to be informed that I have received it, and
saying that other stories are being translated by Madame Viardot
and Tourgénef,&mdash;both of which were unnecessary. [Tolstoy
means that they need neither have sent him the translation,
nor informed him of what they were doing.]</p>

<p>The commencement of <i>Anna Karénina</i> did not find favour
with Tourgénef, who on 14th March wrote from Paris to
A. S. Souvórin, the novelist and proprietor of the <i>Nóvoye
Vrémya</i> (<i>New Times</i>):</p>

<p class="i2">His [Tolstoy's] talent is quite extraordinary, but in <i>Anna
Karénina</i> he, as one says here, <i>a fait fausse route</i>; one feels the
influence of Moscow, Slavophil nobility, Orthodox old maids,
his own isolation, and the absence of real artistic freedom.
Part II is simply dull and shallow&mdash;that's what's the matter.</p>

<p>And writing in similar strains to Polónsky the poet,
Tourgénef said:</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Anna Karénina</i> does not please me, though there are some
truly splendid pages (the steeplechase, the mowing, and the
hunt). But it is all sour: smells of Moscow, holy oil,
old maidishness, Slavophilism, and the aristocracy, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
The cordiality of Tourgénef's appreciation of Tolstoy's
writings in general, is sufficient guarantee that it was no
personal prejudice that led him to speak in this way of a
book which is one of Tolstoy's three most important novels,
and which many people hold to be the best of them all.
What really caused his harsh judgment, is a matter I will
deal with later on.</p>

<p>This summer the whole Tolstoy family went to the
Samára estates, which had already been considerably increased
by the last purchase, and which ultimately exceeded
16,000 acres. Mouhamed Shah with his herd of mares and
his <i>kotchévka</i>&mdash;which Tolstoy called 'our saloon'&mdash;again
appeared on the scene. A second <i>kotchévka</i> was set up
for the use of the Tolstoys themselves, and was so much in
favour that all the members of the family were eager to
occupy it.</p>

<p>The novelty and the peculiarities of steppe farming
interested Tolstoy, and he, as well as other members of his
household, took an active part in harvesting and winnowing.
How primitive were the Samára methods of agriculture may
be shown by mentioning their manner of threshing. A ring
of horses was formed, tied head to tail. In the centre of
the ring stood a driver with a long lash, and the horses
were set trotting round a corresponding circle of sheaves, out
of which they trod the grain.</p>

<p>The virgin soil was ploughed up by five or even six pair
of oxen, wearing round their necks deep-toned bells, sounding
in a minor key. These things, together with the pipes
of the boys who watched the herds, the sultry days, and the
marvellously clear moonlit nights, had a wonderful charm
for the whole party, and this charm was increased by Tolstoy's
capacity to notice and direct attention to whatever
was interesting or beautiful.</p>

<p>The whole family became interested, Behrs tells us, in
their new farming, and some of them went with Tolstoy
as far afield as Orenbourg to purchase cattle and horses.</p>

<p>He bought about a hundred Bashkír mares and crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
them with an English trotter and with horses of other breeds,
hoping to obtain a good new type.</p>

<p>One evening his whole herd, and Mouhamed Shah's as
well, were very nearly driven off by some Kirghiz nomads
who were passing. The invaders were, however, pursued
and driven off by two mounted Bashkír labourers.</p>

<p>Tolstoy declared farming in Samára to be a game of
chance. It cost nearly three times as much to plough up
the land, sow it, and gather in a harvest, as it did to purchase
the freehold of the estate; and if during May and
June there was not at least one good fall of rain, everything
perished; whereas if it rained several times, the
harvest yielded thirty to forty-fold.</p>

<p>One day, at harvest time, a poor wandering Tartar, drawing
two little children in a tiny cart, came up to the balcony
on which the Tolstoys were sitting, and asked to be hired
as a labourer. He was allowed to set up his wigwam in a
field close by, and the Tolstoy children used to go there
every day to feed the little Tartars.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring village lived several well-to-do
Russian peasants with whom Tolstoy was on very good
terms. Either because they were economically independent
and lived in a province where serfdom had not prevailed,
or as a result of Tolstoy's tact and ability to set people
at their ease, these peasants always behaved with dignity
and self-respect. They shook hands when they said 'How
do you do?' and seemed quite at home with the Count.</p>

<p>He used to notice with pleasure the good relations and
complete religious toleration that existed in those parts
between the Orthodox peasants and their Mohammedan
neighbours; and he was also delighted that the priest at
Pátrovka was on friendly terms with the Molokáns he was
trying to convert.</p>

<p>One rainy night, after staying late at this priest's house,
Tolstoy and his brother-in-law completely lost their way.
It was so dark that they could not see their horses' heads.
Behrs was riding an old working horse, which kept pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
to the left. Tolstoy, on hearing this, told him to let the
horse follow its bent. Behrs therefore tied his reins so
that they hung loose, and wrapping himself in his cloak
from the drenching rain, allowed the horse to go where
it liked. Carefully avoiding the ploughed land, it soon
brought them out on to the road, and, curiously enough, to
just the one part of it which was distinguishable from the
extraordinary sameness of the rest, so that the riders knew
just where they were.</p>

<p>The most striking event of this year's stay in Samára was
a horse race, arranged by Tolstoy. Mouhamed Shah was
authorised to announce to the peasants and neighbours that
races would be held on the Count's estate; and invitations
were sent to all likely to take part. Bashkírs and Kirghiz
assembled, bringing with them tents, portable copper boilers,
plenty of koumýs, and even sheep. Oural Cossacks and
Russian peasants also came from the whole surrounding
neighbourhood. In preparation for the race, says Behrs:</p>

<p class="i2">We ourselves chose a level place, measured out a huge circle
three miles in circumference, marked it by running a plough
round, and set up posts. Sheep and even one horse were
prepared with which to regale visitors. By the appointed day
some thousands of people had collected. On the wild steppe,
covered with feather grass, a row of tents appeared, and soon
a motley crowd enlivened it. On the conical hillocks (locally
called 'cones') felt and other carpets were spread, on which
the Bashkírs sat in circles, their legs tucked under them. In
the centre of the circle, out of a large <i>toursouk</i> [a leather bottle
made of an animal's leg] a young Bashkír poured koumýs,
handing the cup to each of the company in turn. Their songs,
and the tunes played on their pipes and reeds, sounded somewhat
dreary to a European ear. Wrestling, at which the
Bashkírs are particularly skilful, could be seen here and there.
Thirty trained horses were entered for the chief race. The
riders were boys of about ten years, who rode without saddles.</p>

<p>This race was for thirty-three miles, and it took exactly
an hour and forty minutes; consequently it was run at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
rate of three minutes a mile. Of the thirty horses, ten ran
the whole distance, the others giving up. The principal
prizes were a horse, an ox, a gun, a clock, and a dressing-gown.
The festival lasted two days, and passed off in
perfect order and very gaily. To Tolstoy's delight no
police were present. The guests all politely thanked their
host and departed highly satisfied. 'Even in the crowd,'
says Behrs, 'it seemed to me that Leo Nikoláyevitch
knew how to evoke <i>entrain</i> combined with respect for good
order.'</p>

<p>Tolstoy visited the Petróvsky Fair, as was his yearly
custom, and stayed at the Bouzouloúk Monastery, where a
hermit resided who was 'saving his soul' by a solitary and
ascetic life. This man lived in an underground catacomb.
When he came out he walked about the garden and showed
his visitors an apple-tree he had planted forty years before,
under which it was his custom to sit when receiving pilgrims.
He spoke to Tolstoy about the Scriptures, and showed him
his catacomb-home, the coffin in which he slept, and the
large crucifix before which he prayed.</p>

<p>Tolstoy considered that the respect paid to this man by
pilgrims and other visitors, was the outcome of genuine
religious feeling, and proved that the hermit, by giving the
example of a pure, unworldly life, supplied a real want.</p>

<p>Readers of Tolstoy's short stories will be aware of the use
to which he subsequently put his knowledge of the Bashkírs
and of the hermit.</p>

<p>On 26th August, after reaching Yásnaya, he wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">Two days ago we arrived home safely....</p>

<p class="i2">We have had an average harvest, but the price of labour has
been enormous, so that finally ends only just meet. For two
months I have not soiled my hands with ink nor my heart
with thoughts. Now I am settling down again to dull, common-place
<i>Anna Karénina</i> with the sole desire to clear a space
quickly, and obtain leisure for other occupations&mdash;only not for
the educational work I love but wish to abandon. It takes too
much time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
His Samára experiences confirmed in him the feeling that
not the civilisation and progress and political struggles of
the Western world and of the small Westernised section of
Russians, were really important, but the great primitive
struggle of plain people to obtain a subsistence in healthy
natural conditions; and he adds in the same letter:</p>

<p class="i2">Why fate took me there [to Samára] I do not know; but I
know that I have listened to speeches in the English Parliament,
which is considered very important, and it seemed to me
dull and insignificant; but there, are flies, dirt, and Bashkír
peasants, and I, watching them with intense respect and
anxiety, became absorbed in listening to them and watching
them, and felt it all to be very important.</p>

<p class="i2">One must live as we lived, in a healthy out-of-the-way part
of Samára, and see the struggle going on before one's eyes of
the nomadic life (of millions of people on an immense territory)
with the primitive agricultural life, in order to realise all the
importance of that struggle.</p>

<p>After their return from the Government of Samára, all
the children got hooping-cough. The Countess caught it
from them, and, being in the sixth month of pregnancy, was
very ill. This resulted in the premature birth of a girl,
Varvára, who lived less than two hours.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's eldest son, Sergius, had now reached the age of
twelve. Besides their English governess and a Swiss lady, the
children had at different times a Swiss, a Frenchman, and
a German as tutors for modern languages. Tutors and
students who acted as tutors, also lodged at Yásnaya and
taught other subjects. A music master came over from
Toúla. The eldest boy had considerable musical talent,
and the family as a whole were musical. As soon as they
had mastered their finger exercises, the Count insisted on
their at once being allowed to learn serious pieces.</p>

<p>Every effort was made to awaken and foster the talent
for drawing and painting which some of the children, and
especially the eldest daughter, Tatiána, possessed; but lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
in these subjects were only given to those who showed real
capacity for them.</p>

<p>Much as Tolstoy disliked the curriculum of the Grammar
Schools ('Gymnasiums,' as they are called in Russia), he did,
not wish to make it impossible for his sons to enter the
University, and they followed the usual classical course.
Sergius passed his examinations each year in Toúla
Gymnasium, being carefully coached at home.</p>

<p>In his <i>Recollections</i> Behrs tells us of Tolstoy's enlivening
influence in the family:</p>

<p class="i2">I cannot sufficiently describe the joyous and happy frame
of mind that usually reigned at Yásnaya Polyána. Its source
was always Leo Nikoláyevitch. In conversation about abstract
questions, about the education of children, about outside
matters&mdash;his opinion was always most interesting. When playing
croquet, or during our walks, he enlivened us all by his
humour and his participation, taking a real part in the game
or the walk.</p>

<p class="i2">With me, he liked to mow, or use the rake; to do gymnastics,
to race, and occasionally to play leap-frog or <i>gorodkí</i> [a
game in which a stick is thrown at some other shorter sticks
placed in a pattern], etc. Though far inferior to him in strength,
for he could lift 180 lbs. with one hand, I could easily match
him in a race, but seldom passed him, for I was always laughing.
That mood accompanied all our exercises. Whenever we
happened to pass where mowers were at work, he would go up
to them and borrow a scythe from the one who seemed most
tired. I of course imitated his example. He would then ask
me, Why we, with well-developed muscles, cannot mow six
days on end, though a peasant does it on rye-bread, and
sleeping on damp earth? 'You just try to do it under such
conditions,' he would add in conclusion. When leaving the
meadow, he would take a handful of hay from the haycock and
sniff it, keenly enjoying its smell.</p>

<p>Children and grown-ups alike played croquet at Yásnaya.
The game generally began after dinner in the evening, and
only finished by candlelight. Behrs says that, having
played it with Tolstoy, he considers croquet to be a game of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
chance. Tolstoy's commendation of a good shot always
pleased the player and aroused the emulation of his opponents.
The kindly irony of his comments on a miss, also
acted as a spur. A simple word from him, uttered just
at the right moment and in the right tone, produced that
<i>entrain</i> which makes any occupation interesting and infects
all who come under its influence.</p>

<p>The sincerity of Tolstoy's nature showed itself in the
frank expression of his passing mood. If, when driving to
the station, he saw that they had missed the train, he would
exclaim, 'Ach! we've missed it!' with such intensity that
every one within earshot would first feel as though a calamity
had occurred, and would then join in the hearty laughter
which his own vehement exclamation evoked in Tolstoy.
It was the same when he made a bad miss at croquet; and
also if, when sitting at home, he suddenly remembered some
engagement he had forgotten to keep. If, as sometimes
happened, his exclamation alarmed his wife, he would half-jokingly
add, like a scolded child, 'I'll never do it again!'</p>

<p>His laughter, which began on a high note, had something
wonderfully infectious about it. His head would hang over
on one side, and his whole body would shake.</p>

<p>His good-natured irony constantly acted as a stimulant to
those about him. If, for instance, some one was in the
dumps about the weather, Tolstoy would say: 'Is your
weather behaving badly?' Or when Behrs was sitting
comfortably listening to a conversation, he would say to
him: 'As you are on the move, you might please bring
me so-and-so.'</p>

<p>When he felt it wise to reject an extra cigar or a second
helping of some favourite dish, he would remark to those
present: 'Wait till I am grown up, and then I will have
two helpings,' or 'two cigars,' as the case might be.</p>

<p>If, says Behrs, 'he noticed any of the children making a
wry or affected face, he generally called out, "Now then, no
grimacing; you'll only spoil your phiz."'</p>

<p>Behrs also tells us that.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
What he called 'the Numidian cavalry' evoked our noisiest
applause. He would unexpectedly spring up from his place
and, raising one arm in the air with its hand hanging quite loose
from the wrist, he would run lightly through the rooms. All
the children, and sometimes the grown-ups also, would follow
his example with the same suddenness.</p>

<p>Tolstoy read aloud very well, and would often read to
the family or to visitors.</p>

<p>His contempt for doctors and medicine is plainly indicated
both in <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karénina</i>. Like
Rousseau he considered that the practice of medicine should
be general and not confined to one profession; and this
opinion inclined him to approve of the folk-remedies used
by the peasants. But he did not go the length of refusing
to call in a doctor when one of the family was seriously ill.</p>

<p>Before the year closed, Tolstoy's aunt, Pelagéya Ilýnishna
Úshkof, with whom he had lived in his young days in Kazán,
also passed away. She had been separated from her husband
before his death in 1869, and had long not even seen him,
though they remained quite friendly towards one another.
She was very religious in an Orthodox Church way, and after
her husband's death retired to the Óptin nunnery. Subsequently
she moved to the Toúla nunnery, but arranged to
spend much of her time at Yásnaya; where in her eightieth
year she fell ill and died. She was in general a good-tempered
though not clever woman, and all her life long
strictly observed the ceremonies of the Church and thought
that she firmly believed its teaching about redemption and
resurrection; yet she was so afraid of death that on her
death-bed she was reluctant to receive the eucharist, because
it brought home to her mind the fact that she was dying;
and as a consequence of the sufferings caused by the fear
of death, she became irritable with all about her.</p>

<p>A servant who lived in the house at the time, tells that
while at Yásnaya she used, on the first of each month, to
send for a priest. As soon as he arrived, and began the
usual ceremony of blessing with holy water, Tolstoy would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
escape and hide himself. Not till the gardener, Semyón&mdash;whom
he used to send into the conservatory to reconnoitre&mdash;brought
him word that the priest had gone, would
Tolstoy reappear in the house.</p>

<p>About that time, however, his attitude towards Church
ceremonies altered. His man-servant Sergéy Arboúzof (who
saw only the external signs of the complex inner struggle
going on in Tolstoy) tells us:</p>

<p class="i2">Suddenly a wonderful change came over him, of which I was
a witness. In 1875 a priest, Vasíly Ivánovitch, from the Toúla
Seminary, used to come to teach theology to Tolstoy's children.
At first, Leo Nikoláyevitch hardly ever talked to him, but it
once happened that a snow-storm obliged Vasíly Ivánovitch to
stop the night at our house. The Count began a conversation
with him, and they did not go to bed till daylight. They talked
the whole night.</p>

<p class="i2">From that day Leo Nikoláyevitch became very thoughtful,
and always talked with Vasíly Ivánovitch. When Lent came
round, the Count got up one morning and said, 'I am going to
do my devotions, and prepare to receive communion. You can
go back to bed, but first tell the coachman not to get up.
I will saddle Kalmýk (his favourite horse at that time) myself.
Forgive me, Sergéy, if I have ever offended you!' and he went
off to church.</p>

<p class="i2">From that day for a couple of years he always went to church,
seldom missing a Sunday. The whole village was surprised,
and asked, 'What has the priest told the Count, that has
suddenly made him so fond of church-going?'</p>

<p class="i2">It used to happen that the Count would come into my hut
when I was teaching my little boy religion.</p>

<p class="i2">'What are you teaching him?' he would ask.</p>

<p class="i2">And I used to say, 'To pray.'</p>

<p class="i2">'Ah!' said he, 'that is right. A man who does not pray to
God is not a real man.'</p>


<h3>1876</h3>

<p>The publication of <i>Anna Karénina</i> was renewed in the first
four numbers of the <i>Russian Messenger</i> for 1876.</p>

<p>On 1st March Tolstoy writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Things are still not all right with us. My wife does not get
over her last illness, coughs, gets thin, and has first fever and
then headaches. And therefore the house lacks well-being,
and I lack mental tranquillity, which I now particularly need
for my work. The end of winter and beginning of spring is
always my chief time for work, and I must finish my novel,
which now wearies me.... I always hope a tooth will come
loose in your jaw, or in your thrashing machine, and cause you
to go to Moscow. Then I shall spin a cobweb at Kozlóvka [the
nearest station to Yásnaya] and catch you.</p>

<p>In April Fet wrote to Tolstoy to say that he had been
seriously ill, had thought he was dying, and 'wished to call
you to see how I departed.' On 29th April Tolstoy replies
in a letter notable because it gives us a glimpse of the progress
he had made in the fierce five-year inner struggle with
doubt which preceded the production of his <i>Confession</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">I am grateful to you for thinking of calling me to see your
departure, when you supposed it was near. I will do the same
when I get ready to go <i>thither</i>, if I am able to think. No one
will be so necessary to me at that moment as you and my
brother. When death draws near, intercourse with people who
in this life look beyond its bounds, is precious and cheering;
and you and those rare <i>real</i> people I have met in life, always
stand on the very verge and see clearly, just because they look
now at Nirvana&mdash;the illimitable, the unknown&mdash;and now at
Sansara; and that glance at Nirvana strengthens their sight.
But worldly people, however much they may talk about God,
are unpleasant to you and me, and must be a torment when
one is dying, for they do not see what we see, namely the God
who 'is more indefinite and distant, but loftier and more
indubitable,' as was said in that article.</p>

<p class="i2">You are ill and think of death, and I am alive and do not
cease thinking of and preparing for the same thing.... Much
that I have thought, I have tried to express in the last chapter
of the April number of the <i>Russian Messenger</i> [<i>Anna Karénina</i>,
Part I, Chap. XX].</p>

<p>The passage referred to, telling of the death of Lévin's
brother, is evidently based on the death of Tolstoy's own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
brother Demetrius; and it may here be mentioned that
many characters in <i>Anna Karénina</i> are drawn more or less
closely from life. For instance, Agáfya Miháylovna, the
servant, was a real person, and that was her real name. She
died at Yásnaya only a few years ago. Yásnaya Polyána
itself, in many of its details, is also described in the novel.</p>

<p>On 12th May Tolstoy again writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">It is already five days since I received the horse, and every
day I prepare but never make time to write to you. Here the
spring and summer life has begun, and our house is full of
guests and of bustle. This summer life seems to me like a
dream: it contains some slight remains of my real, winter life,
but consists chiefly of visions, now pleasant and now unpleasant,
from some absurd world not ruled by sane sense. Among
these visions came your beautiful stallion. I am very much
obliged to you for it. Where am I to send the money to?...</p>

<p class="i2">An event which occupies me very much at present is
Sergey's examinations, which begin on the 27th.... What
a terrible summer! Here it is dreadful and mournful to look at
the wood, especially at the young trees. They have all perished.</p>

<p>On 18th May he wrote again:</p>

<p class="i2">I have been slow in answering your long and cordial letter
because I have been unwell and dispirited, as I still am, but I
will write at least a few lines. Our house is full of people: my
niece Nagórnaya with two children, the Kouzmínskys with four
children; and Sónya [the Countess] is still poorly, and I dejected
and dull-minded. Our one hope was for good weather, and
that we have not got. As you and I resemble one another,
you must know the condition in which one feels oneself to be,
now a God from whom nothing is hid, and now stupider than
a horse. In that state I am at present. So do not be exacting.
Till next letter, yours,</p>

<p class="rightm smcap">L. Tolstoy.</p>

<p class="p2">The Kouzmínskys referred to above were Tánya, her
husband, and their family. They spent every summer at
Yásnaya, in the 'wing' house. When discussing any
excursion or other undertaking with Mr. Kouzmínsky,
Tolstoy would often say, 'But we must hear what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Authorities have to say about it,' the Authorities being
their wives.</p>

<p>Passing into his 'summer condition,' Tolstoy's attention
to <i>Anna Karénina</i> slackened; but before the end of the
year he set energetically to work to finish it. The interest
aroused by the book was extreme, and the story goes that
Moscow ladies used to send to the establishment where the
novel was being printed, to try to find out what the continuation
would be.</p>

<p>On 21st July Tolstoy writes inviting Fet's brother, Peter
Afánasyevitch, a great lover of horses, to accompany him to
Samára; and in the same letter he makes an allusion to the
troubles of the Slavs in Turkey, where fighting had already
been going on for a twelvemonth with the Herzegovinians.
Peter Afanásyevitch had gone as a volunteer, and had returned
after the failure of the insurrection.</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>21 July 1876.</i></p>

<p class="i2">I am very much to blame, dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch, for
having been so slow in writing to you. I prepare to write
every day, but cannot find time because I am doing nothing....
Stráhof was here a week ago, and we philosophised to the
point of weariness....</p>

<p class="i2">I press the hand of Peter Afanásyevitch. I should like to
hear his stories about Herzegovina, in the existence of which I
do not believe!</p>

<p class="i2">I am arranging to go to Samára in September. If Peter
Afanásyevitch has no plans for September, will not he go
with me to see the Kirghiz and their horses? How jolly it
would be!</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the fact that Tolstoy,
who understood horses very well, was at this time interested
in horse-breeding as a source of revenue. To buy them he
visited Orenbourg, where he met General Kryzhanóvsky,
a friend who had been one of his superior officers in
Sevastopol and was now Governor-General of this northern
Province. They spent the time together very pleasantly
recalling their past experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>To his wife, who had found it hard to consent to his
absence, he wrote in September:</p>

<p class="i2">I know that it is hard for you, and that you are afraid; but
I saw the effort you made to control yourself and not to hinder
me and, were it possible, I loved you yet more on that account.
If only God grants you to spend the time well, healthily,
energetically and usefully!... Lord have mercy on me and
on thee!</p>

<p>In a letter of 13th November Tolstoy writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">Pity me for two things: (1) a good-for-nothing coachman
took the stallions to Samára and, wishing to take a short cut,
drowned Gouneba in a bog within ten miles of the estate; (2)
I sleep and cannot write; I despise myself for laziness and do
not allow myself to take up any other work.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight years after the loss of Gouneba, the
Countess, in speaking to me of her husband's qualities as a
man of affairs, remarked that his schemes were very good,
but that he generally spoilt them by lack of care in details.
'For instance,' she remarked, 'it was quite a good idea of
his to send a very fine stallion which cost Rs. 2000 [about
£260] to our estate in Samára. There were no such
horses in the district; but he must needs entrust it to a
drunken Tartar who made away with it and said he had
lost it.'</p>

<p>On 7th December 1876 Tolstoy wrote to Fet acknowledging
a poem, 'Among the Stars,' which the latter had
sent him:</p>

<p class="i2">That poem is not only worthy of you, but is specially,
specially good, with that philosophic-poetic character which I
expect from you. It is excellent that it is said by the stars....
It is also good, as my wife remarked, that on the same sheet on
which the poem is written, you pour out your grief that the
price of kerosene has risen to 12 copecks. That is an indirect
but sure sign of a poet.</p>

<p>The reader is by this time well aware of Tolstoy's devotion
to music. Though it was at times crowded out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
life by other interests, he always returned to it with ardour
when opportunity offered. Behrs tells us that Tolstoy
generally, when playing, chose serious music.</p>

<p class="i2">He often sat down to the piano before beginning to work....
He always accompanied my youngest sister [Tánya] and enjoyed
her singing very much. I noticed that the sensation
music evoked in him expressed itself by a slight pallor and a
scarcely perceptible grimace, suggestive of something like
terror. Hardly a day passed in summer without my sister singing
and without the piano being played. Occasionally we all
sang together, and he always played the accompaniments.</p>

<p>As Tolstoy's spiritual crisis approached, the attraction of
music for him seemed to increase, and it was about this
period, that is to say in December 1876, that he made
acquaintance with the composer P. I. Tschaikóvsky, who had
held the post of Director of the Moscow Conservatoire, the
first seeds of which Tolstoy had helped to plant nearly
twenty years before.</p>

<p>Tschaikóvsky had from his youth up been a devoted
admirer of Tolstoy, whose skill in reading the human heart
appeared to him almost superhuman. He was therefore
highly gratified when Tolstoy of his own accord sought his
acquaintance. At first their personal intercourse did not
appear to lessen the composer's reverence for the author,
for on 23rd December 1876 he wrote to a friend:</p>

<p class="i2">Count L. N. Tolstoy spent some time here recently. He
visited me several times and spent two whole evenings with me.
I am tremendously flattered, and proud of the interest I have
inspired in him, and for my part am completely enchanted by
his ideal personality.</p>

<p>Tschaikóvsky induced Nicholas Rubinstein, then Director
of the Moscow Conservatoire, to arrange a musical
evening solely for Tolstoy, and at this concert, Rubinstein,
Fitzenhagen, and Adolph Bródsky, who is now Principal
of the Manchester College of Music, were among the chief
performers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
One of the pieces performed by a quartet was Tschaikóvsky's
'Andante in D Major,' which so affected Tolstoy that
he wept. 'Never, perhaps, in my life,' says Tschaikóvsky,
'was I so flattered, or my vanity as a composer so touched,
as when Leo Nikoláyevitch, sitting next to me and listening
to the quartet performing my Andante, burst into tears.'</p>

<p>After Tolstoy had returned to Yásnaya he wrote to
Tschaikóvsky, sending him a collection of folk-songs, and
saying:</p>

<p class="i2">I send you the songs, dear Peter Ilyítch. I have again looked
them through. They will be a wonderful treasure in your
hands. But for God's sake work them up and use them in a
Mozart-Haydn style, and not in a Beethoven-Schumann-Berlioz,
artificial way, seeking the unexpected. How much I left unsaid
to you. I really said nothing of what I wanted to say.
There was no time. I was enjoying myself. This last stay of
mine in Moscow will remain one of the best of my reminiscences.
Never have I received so precious a reward for my
literary labours as on that wonderful evening.</p>

<p>Tschaikóvsky replied:</p>

<p class="i2">Count, I am sincerely grateful to you for sending the songs.
I must tell you candidly that they have been taken down by an
unskilful hand, and bear only traces of their pristine beauty.
The chief defect is that they have been artificially squeezed
and forced into a regular, measured form. Only Russian dance
music has a rhythm and a regular and equally accentuated
beat; but folk-ballads have of course nothing in common with
dance songs. Moreover, most of these songs are, arbitrarily
it seems, written in a solemn D Major, which again does not
suit a real Russian song, which almost always has an indefinite
tonality approximating nearest of all to ancient Church music.
In general, the songs you have sent me cannot be worked up
in a regular and systematic way: that is to say, one cannot
make a collection of them, because for that they would have to be
taken down as nearly as possible in the way in which the people
perform them. That is an extremely difficult matter, demanding
fine musical feeling and great historico-musical erudition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Except Balakíref, and to some extent Prokoúnin, I do not know
any one competent for the task. But as material for symphonic
treatment, your songs can be of use, and are even very good
material, which I certainly will avail myself of in one way
or other.</p>

<p>It is rather disappointing to find that the intercourse between
these two men, each so great in his own way, and each
such an admirer of the other's genius, was not continued.</p>

<p>Tschaikóvsky's expectations had been pitched too high,
and he felt a certain disappointment that his 'demigod'
was, after all, but human. He had dreaded to meet the
novelist lest the latter should penetrate the secret recesses
of his soul; but, says Tschaikóvsky:</p>

<p class="i2">He who in his writings was the deepest of heart-seers,
proved in personal contact to be a man of simple, whole, and
frank nature, showing very little of the omniscience I had
feared.... It was plain he did not at all regard me as a
subject for his observation, but simply wanted to chat about
music, in which he was then interested. He took a pleasure
in denying Beethoven, and plainly expressed doubts of his
genius. This was a trait not at all worthy of a great man.
To pull down a universally acknowledged genius to the level
of one's own intelligence, is characteristic of small people.</p>

<p>Feeling thus, Tschaikóvsky purposely avoided meeting
Tolstoy again, and even took a temporary aversion to <i>Anna
Karénina</i>, though eventually he returned to his former
admiration of Tolstoy's novels.</p>

<p>Tschaikóvsky was not aware of the reasons Tolstoy had
for the unorthodox position he held on art generally and
music in particular: reasons which it will be more in place
to deal with later on, and which I have in fact already
treated of at some length in a previous work, <i>Tolstoy and
his Problems</i>. Here let it suffice to say that there is plenty
of evidence to show that Tolstoy can enjoy Beethoven, and
enjoy even the works of Beethoven's last period, which are
the ones he criticises. There is, for instance, the episode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
with Mlle. Oberlender, which will be recounted later on,
and we have his own statement in <i>What is Art?</i>:</p>

<p class="i2">I should mention that whatever other people understand of
the productions of Beethoven's later period, I, being very susceptible
to music, equally understand. For a long time I used
to attune myself so as to delight in those shapeless improvisations
which form the subject-matter of the works of Beethoven's
later period; but I had only to consider the question of art
seriously, and to compare the impression I received from
Beethoven's later works with those pleasant, clear, and strong
musical impressions which are transmitted, for instance, by the
melodies of Bach (his arias), Haydn, Mozart, Chopin (when his
melodies are not overloaded with complications and ornamentation),
and of Beethoven himself in his earlier period, and above
all, with the impressions produced by folk-songs,&mdash;Italian,
Norwegian, or Russian,&mdash;by the Hungarian <i>tzardas</i>, and other
such simple, clear, and powerful music, and the obscure, almost
unhealthy excitement from Beethoven's later pieces that I had
artificially evoked in myself was destroyed.</p>

<p>His work among peasant children has convinced him
that the normal human being possesses capacities for the
enjoyment of art; and that in most unexpected places the
capacity to produce admirable art is now lying latent.
That is why he sets up Brevity, Simplicity, and Sincerity as
the criterions of art, and why he believes that folk-tales
and folk-songs and folk-dances, the Gospel parables, such Old
Testament stories as the history of Joseph, the Arabian
Nights and the Christmas Carol; and music such as the
<i>tzardas</i>, the <i>Swanee River</i>, the <i>Old Hundredth</i>, and Bach's
arias, are infinitely more important to the life and well-being
of humanity than <i>King Lear</i> or the <i>Ninth Symphony</i>.</p>

<p>Tolstoy&mdash;who had boasted of not reading newspapers, and
who had lived so detached from politics and the events of
contemporary history&mdash;began at this time to feel keenly
interested in a question closely connected with Russia's
foreign policy.</p>

<p>Following the insurrection in Herzegovina, another had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
broken out in Bulgaria in May 1876, but had been quickly
suppressed by the Turks, who burnt some sixty-five villages;
the Bashi-Bazouks committing unspeakable atrocities on
the defenceless inhabitants. At the commencement of July,
Servia and Montenegro declared war against Turkey; but,
in spite of help rendered by numerous Russian volunteers,
they were soon crushed by the Turks, and would have been
completely at their mercy had not Russia, on 31st October,
issued an ultimatum demanding an armistice, which Turkey
conceded. On 10th November Alexander II made a speech
in the Moscow Krémlin, in which he declared that he would
act independently of the other powers unless satisfactory
guarantees of reform were obtained forthwith from the
Sultan. These events gradually led to the war which broke
out between Russia and Turkey in April 1877.</p>

<p>Before this, however, in the letter of 13th November
1876, already quoted, Tolstoy wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I went to Moscow to hear about the war. This whole affair
agitates me greatly. It is well for those to whom it is clear;
but I am frightened when I begin to reflect on all the complexity
of the conditions amid which history is made, and how
some Madame A.&mdash;with her vanity&mdash;becomes an indispensable
cog in the whole machine!</p>

<p>The Russo-Turkish imbroglio led, early in 1877, to
a split between Tolstoy and Katkóf. Tolstoy, at bottom
and in his own original way, was certainly a reformer; and
his alliance with Katkóf, who was quite reactionary, had
always been rather like the yoking of an ox with an ass.
At this time Katkóf was ardent for the liberation of the
Slavs from Turkish tyranny, laudatory of those who volunteered
for the war, and eager for the aggrandisement of
Russia. Tolstoy, with his knowledge of the realities of war
and his insight into the motives that actuate the men who
fight, had his doubts about the heroic and self-sacrificing
character of the volunteers and the purity of the patriotism
of the press; and he expressed these doubts very plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
in some of the concluding chapters of <i>Anna Karénina</i>: as,
for instance, where he makes Lévin say of 'the unanimity
of the press':</p>

<p class="i2">'That's been explained to me: as soon as there's a war
their incomes are doubled. So how can they help believing in
the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and
all the rest of it?'</p>

<p>The result was that when the final chapters of the
novel were appearing in the <i>Russian Messenger</i> during the
first months of 1877, Katkóf returned some of the MS.
to Tolstoy with numerous corrections and a letter saying
that he could not print it unless his corrections were
accepted.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was furious that a journalist should dare to
alter a single word in his book, and in reply sent a sharp
letter to Katkóf, which resulted in a rupture. Tolstoy
issued the last part of <i>Anna Karénina</i> separately in book
form and not in the magazine, besides, of course, issuing
the whole work in book form, as usual; and, in the May
number of his <i>Russian Messenger</i>, Katkóf had to wind up
the story as best he could, by giving a brief summary of
the concluding part.</p>

<p>These events throw light on the following letter to
Fet:</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>23 March 1877.</i></p>

<p class="i2">You can't imagine how glad I am to have your approval of
my writings, dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch, and in general to
receive your letter. You write that the <i>Russian Messenger</i> has
printed some one else's poem, while your <i>Temptation</i> lies waiting.
It is the dullest and deadest editorial office in existence.
They have become terribly repulsive to me, not on my own
account, but for the sake of others....</p>

<p class="i2">My head is now better, but as it gets better it has to work
that much harder. March and the beginning of April are the
months when I work most, and I still continue to be under the
delusion that what I am writing is very important, though I
know that in a month's time I shall be ashamed to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
that I thought so. Have you noticed that a new line has now
been started, and that everybody is writing poetry: very
bad poetry, but they all do it. Some five new poets have
introduced themselves to me lately.</p>

<p>The dislike Tolstoy felt of the artificially stimulated war
fever (though, to do Katkóf and his friends justice, one must
admit that no European Power during the last fifty years
has had more justification for war than Russia had for
intervening in defence of the Slav population of Turkey)
was connected with the religious impulse that was beginning
to reshape his whole life; but it does not appear that he
actually disapproved of the war after Russia had officially
commenced it. What he primarily objected to was, that
private individuals should push the Government into a war.</p>

<p>An influence which has left its traces in the latter part of
<i>Anna Karénina</i> (particularly Part VII, Chap. 21) was
Tolstoy's intercourse, about this time, with some of the
most prominent followers of Lord Radstock, who frequently
visited Russia and obtained considerable influence with a
number of people in certain aristocratic Petersburg circles.
One of these people, Count A. P. Bóbrinsky, who had been
Minister of Ways of Communication, made Tolstoy's
acquaintance and had animated religious discussions with
him. Both Bóbrinsky and Colonel Páshkof (another very
prominent Radstockite) for a while cherished hopes of
winning Tolstoy over to Evangelical Christianity, and
making him the spokesman of their cause. Tolstoy, as the
event proved, was quite capable of throwing himself whole-heartedly
into a religious movement; but he needed a faith
much more clear-cut than the scheme of Redemption by the
blood of Jesus: one that faced the facts of life, dealt
explicitly with the bread-and-butter problem, and told men
how to regard the fact that some people have to overtax
their strength without ever reaching an assured maintenance,
while others have a superabundance provided for them
from their birth without ever needing to do a stroke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
work. His profound contempt for Evangelical doctrines
flashed out twenty years later, in the 17th Chapter of
Book II of <i>Resurrection</i>.</p>

<p>It was a little before this that Fet told Tolstoy the
following story. Sauntering in a churchyard, he had come
upon an inscription which touched him more than any
epitaph he had ever read. The tombstone was in the form
of an obelisk of plain grey sandstone. On one of its four
sides were deeply cut the words:</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Here is buried the body of the peasant girl Mary</i>;</p>


<p>on another side:</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Here also is buried an infant of the female sex</i>.</p>

<p>On the side opposite the name of the deceased stood these
words ill-spelt:</p>

<p class="i2"><i>This, my dear, is the last adornment I can give thee</i>;</p>

<p>and below stood the name of</p>

<p class="i2"><i>Retired non-commissioned officer So-and-so</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">In his next letter Tolstoy writes:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><i>18 October 1876.</i></p>

<p class="i2"><i>This, my dear, is the last adornment I can give thee</i> is
charming! I have told it twice, and each time my voice
has broken with tears.</p>


<h3>1877</h3>

<p>In Tolstoy's next letter to Fet, dated 11th January, we
get a glimpse of one of the reasons that led this
strenuous worker to prefer a country life:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch</span>,&mdash;One does not strike or cut
off the head that owns its fault! I confess that I am quite at
fault towards you. But truly, in Moscow I am in a condition of
irresponsibility; my nerves are out of order, the hours turn to
minutes, and as though on purpose, the people I do not want
turn up and prevent my seeing those whom I do want.</p>

<p>Among the people whom in his search for truth Tolstoy
did want to know, were some of the leading scientists of
that day&mdash;a day when many men thought that Darwin had
opened the gateway to a knowledge which would gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
solve the mysteries of life and death, the here and the
hereafter. The great literary fame Tolstoy now enjoyed
made it an easy matter to make such acquaintances.</p>

<p>One of the scientists he got to know, was a celebrated
professor of Chemistry, A. M. Boutleróf, whom to his amazement
he found to be much concerned with table-turning and
spiritualism; occupations Tolstoy held in contempt.</p>

<p>A letter to Fet, dated 14th April, gives some inkling of
what was going on in Tolstoy's mind at this time:</p>

<p class="i2">I value every letter of yours, especially such as this last!
You would hardly believe how pleased I am at what you write
'On the existence of the Deity.' I agree with it all, and
should like to say much about it, but cannot in a letter, and am
too busy. It is the first time you have spoken to me about the
Deity&mdash;God. And I have long been thinking unceasingly about
that chief problem. Do not say that one cannot think about
it! One not only can, but must! In all ages the best, the
real people, have thought about it. And if we cannot think of
it as they did, we must find out <i>how</i>. Have you read <i>Pensées
de Pascal</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> have you read it recently with a mature head-piece?
When (which God grant) you come to see me, we will
talk of many things, and I will give you that book. Were I
free from my novel&mdash;of which the end is already in type and I
am correcting the proofs&mdash;I would at once on receipt of your
letter have come to you.</p>

<p>In the middle of this summer Tolstoy, bringing with him
N. Stráhof, paid Fet an unexpected visit. The latter
had at this time engaged as governess a Mlle. Oberlender,
an excellent pianist, and in his <i>Recollections</i> he tells us that
on this visit:</p>

<p class="i2">The Count, a sensitive esthete by nature, was greatly taken
by the piano playing of Mlle. Oberlender. He sat down to play
duets with her, and they played through almost the whole of
Beethoven.</p>

<p>Fet quotes Tolstoy's comment on the lady's performance:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
'When we were young, such pianists travelled across Europe
giving concerts. She reads any piece of music as you read
poetry, finding just the suitable expression for each note.'</p>

<p>Towards the end of July, Tolstoy, accompanied by
N. Stráhof, visited for the first time the Monastery of
Óptin, which is situated in the Kaloúga Government, and is
about 135 miles to the west of Yásnaya. A very prominent
figure in the monastic world at that time was the <i>Staretz</i>
Father Ambrose, with whom Tolstoy had some long conversations.
Among others whose acquaintance Tolstoy made
there, was a monk who had formerly been an officer in
the Horse Guards. One of the most important of the
works Tolstoy left for publication after his death, is a remarkable
novel called <i>Father Sergius</i>, the hero of which is a
man of the world who becomes a monk, acquires a reputation
for sanctity, and then yields to temptation and ends as
an outcast. His visits to the Óptin Monastery, which
were repeated three times, supplied Tolstoy with material
which many years later he utilised in that work.</p>

<p>At Óptin, Tolstoy had met his friend Prince Obolénsky,
to whom on his return journey he paid a visit at the latter's
estate of Beryósino. Here he renewed acquaintance with
N. Rubinstein, who was staying with Obolénsky, and whose
pianoforte playing he enjoyed intensely.</p>

<p>A visit which much interested Tolstoy was paid him
about this time by an itinerant story-teller, expert in
folk-lore, wielding beautifully the simple language of
the people, such as Tolstoy loves and has utilised in his
stories. He took down in writing some of this traveller's
tales, and from them subsequently worked up into literary
form <i>What Men Live By</i>, <i>The Three Hermits</i> (included
in <i>Twenty-three Tales</i>), and some others. The root idea
of <i>What Men Live By</i> is that of an angel sent by God
to do penance on earth for a well-intentioned act of disobedience.
It seems that it is one of the most widely disseminated
of the world's legends, appearing and reappearing
in the literature of many countries through many centuries.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1877 a number of Turkish prisoners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of war were located in an abandoned sugar-factory between
Toúla and Yásnaya. Tolstoy visited them there, and found
that they were fairly well treated. Being himself greatly
concerned about religion, he naturally talked to them on
that subject, and was much impressed when he found that
each of them had a copy of the Koran in his kit.</p>

<p>On 6th December another son, Andrew (Andréy), was born.</p>

<p>All through this year, amid bustle and activity of various
kinds, spiritual problems continued to torment Tolstoy, and
his physical health began to show signs of the strain. Here
is a note to Fet, dated 2nd September:</p>

<p class="i2">Just now I am constantly out hunting and am busy arranging
how to place our educational staff for the winter. I have been
to Moscow looking for a teacher and a tutor. To-day I feel
quite ill.</p>


<h3>1878</h3>

<p>Nor did matters improve as the months went on,
for on 27th January he again writes:</p>

<p class="i2">Most unfortunately your suppositions, dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch,
are wrong. Not only am I not at work, but the reason I
failed to answer you was because I have been ill all this time.
Lately I have even been in bed for some days. A chill in
various forms: teeth and side, and the result is that time goes
by&mdash;my best time&mdash;and I do no work.</p>

<p>Then follows a touch showing how, in many matters, his
wife's mind was still attuned to his own, though she was not
sharing his spiritual struggles, and in the matter of the
education of the children there was already some disagreement
between them:</p>

<p class="i2">On reading it I said to my wife, 'Fet's poem is charming, but
there is one word that is wrong.' She was nursing and bustling
about at the time; but at tea, having quieted down, she took up
the poem to read, and at once pointed out the words 'as the
Gods'&mdash;which I considered bad.</p>

<p>On 25th March 1878 he writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">Last week, after seventeen years' absence, I went to Petersburg
to purchase some land in Samára from General B....</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
There I met a pair of Orlóf Generals who made me shudder:
it was just as though one were standing between two sets of
rails with goods trains passing. To enter into the minds of
these Generals, I had to recall the rare days of drunkenness
I have experienced, or the days of my very earliest childhood.</p>

<p>After completing <i>Anna Karénina</i> Tolstoy again took up
<i>The Decembrists</i>, which he had put aside in favour of <i>War
and Peace</i> fourteen years before. As already mentioned, a
second cousin of Tolstoy's mother, Prince S. G. Volkónsky,
had been a prominent Decembrist; and Tolstoy had at his
disposal a number of family diaries and journals throwing
much light on the subject of that conspiracy. While in
Petersburg he made personal acquaintance with some of the
survivors of the movement, and also applied to the Commandant
of the Petropávlof Fortress&mdash;who happened to
be an officer under whom he had served in the Crimea&mdash;for
permission to see the Alexis dungeons, in which the Decembrists
had been confined. The Commandant received him
very politely, allowed him to see over other parts of the
fortress, but told him that, though any one could enter the
dungeons, only three persons in the whole Empire&mdash;the
Emperor, the Commandant, and the Chief of the Gendarmes&mdash;having
once entered them, could again leave them.</p>

<p>Finally, after writing three fragments of it, Tolstoy
abandoned this novel, to which he had devoted much
time. The subject was one he could hardly have dealt
with frankly without getting into trouble with the Censor;
and he had been refused permission to study the State
Archives; but in the following passage Behrs gives another,
and a curiously characteristic, reason for Tolstoy's decision:</p>

<p class="i2">He affirmed that the Decembrist insurrection was a result
of the influence of French nobles, a large number of whom had
emigrated to Russia after the French Revolution. As tutors
in aristocratic families, they educated the whole Russian
nobility, which explains the fact that many of the Decembrists
were Catholics. The belief that the movement was due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
foreign influence, and was not a purely national one, sufficed to
prevent Tolstoy from sympathising with it.</p>

<p>Another letter to Fet again shows the direction in which
Tolstoy's mind was working:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><i>6 April 1878.</i></p>

<p class="i2">I have received your delightful and long letter, dear Afanásy
Afanásyevitch. Do not praise me. Really you see in me too
much good, and in others too much bad. One thing in me is
good: that I understand you and therefore love you. But
though I love you as you are, I am always angry with you for
this, that 'Martha is anxious about many things; but one thing
is needful.' And in you that one thing is very strong, but
somehow you disdain it and are more concerned about arranging
a billiard room. Don't suppose that I refer to poems: though
I expect them to come too! But it is not of them I speak;
they will come in spite of the billiards; I am speaking of a conception
of the world which would make it unnecessary to be
angry at the stupidity of mortals. Were you and I to be pounded
together in a mortar and moulded into two people, we should
make a capital pair. But at present you are so attached to
the things of this life, that should they some day fail you, it
will go hard with you; while I am so indifferent to them, that
life becomes uninteresting, and I depress others by an eternal
pouring 'from void into vacuum'! Do not suppose that I have
gone mad; I am merely out of sorts, but hope you will love me
though I be black.</p>

<p>The prolonged mental struggle through which Tolstoy
passed with great suffering during the years 1874-78, was
quite evident to those about him, at least from 1876 onward.
Not merely did he go regularly to church, and shut himself
up in his study morning and evening to pray, but his
former high spirits subsided, and his desire to become meek
and humble was plainly noticeable. One result of his
altered attitude was, that he felt keenly that it was wrong
to have an enemy. Accordingly he wrote Tourgénef to
that effect, and held out to him the right hand of friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>To this Tourgénef replied:</p>

<p class="p2 rightm"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>8 May 1878</i>.</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Leo Nikoláyevitch</span>,&mdash;I only to-day received your letter,
addressed <i>poste-restante</i>. It gladdened and touched me very
much. With the greatest readiness will I renew our former
friendship, and I warmly press the hand you hold out to me.
You are quite right in supposing me to have no hostile
feelings towards you. If ever they existed they have long
since disappeared, and the recollection of you only remains as
of a man to whom I am sincerely attached, and of a writer
whose first steps it was my good fortune to be the first to hail,
and each new work from whom has always aroused in me the
liveliest interest. I am heartily glad of the cessation of the
misunderstandings that arose between us.</p>

<p class="i2">I hope this summer to be in the Government of Orlóf, and in
that case we shall of course see one another. Till then, I wish
you all that is good, and once more press your hand in friendship.</p>

<p>On 13th June, on the point of starting for Samára with
the elder children and their tutor, Tolstoy writes to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I have seldom so enjoyed a summer as this year, but a week
ago I caught cold and fell ill, and only to-day have I come to
life again.</p>

<p>Somewhat later in the summer the Countess, with the
younger children, joined her husband in Samára.</p>

<p>Hardly were the Tolstoys back from Samára before
Tourgénef wrote from Moscow that he would be in Toúla
on the following Monday, 7th August. Tolstoy, accompanied
by his brother-in-law, drove thither to meet him, and
brought him to Yásnaya, where he passed a couple of days.
Both writers were delighted to feel that their seventeen-year
disagreement was ended; and the Countess, who when
a girl had known Tourgénef well, was equally pleased to
welcome him to the house.</p>

<p>A lady who was there at the time, tells us that the two
writers spent much of their time in philosophic and religious
conversation in Tolstoy's study, but:</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
When they came out into the sitting-room their conversation
became general and took a different turn. Tourgénef told
with pleasure of the villa Bougival which he had just bought
near Paris, and of its comfort and arrangements, saying, 'We
have built a charming conservatory, costing ten thousand
francs,' and 'we' did so-and-so and so-and-so, meaning by 'we,'
the Viardot family and himself.</p>

<p class="i2">'Of an evening we often play <i>vint</i> [a game similar to bridge]&mdash;do
you?' he asked Tolstoy.</p>

<p class="i2">'No, we never play cards,' replied the Count, and turned the
conversation to another topic.</p>

<p class="i2">Knowing that he was fond of chess, the Countess Tolstoy
asked him to play a game with her eldest son, a lad of fifteen,
saying, 'He will all his life remember having played with
Tourgénef.'</p>

<p class="i2">Tourgénef condescendingly agreed, and began a game, while
continuing to talk to us.</p>

<p class="i2">'In Paris I often used to play chess and was considered a
good player. They called me <i>le chevalier de pion</i>. I am fond
of pawns.... Do you know the new phrase now in fashion
among the French&mdash;<i>vieux jeu</i>? Whatever you say, a Frenchman
replies, "<i>Vieux jeu!</i>"'</p>

<p class="i2">'Eh! but one must not joke with you,' he exclaimed suddenly,
turning to his youthful opponent. 'You have all but done for me.'</p>

<p class="i2">And he began to play carefully, and only won the game with
difficulty, for young Tolstoy really played chess excellently.</p>

<p class="i2">At evening tea Tourgénef told how he had played the part
of a satyr at M<sup>me</sup> Viardot's private theatricals, and how some
of the audience had gazed at him with amazement. We knew
that he had himself written the piece (a sort of operetta)
for those theatricals, and knew also that Russians, both
abroad and at home, disapproved of his playing the fool for
M<sup>me</sup> Viardot's amusement; and we all felt uncomfortable. In
telling it he seemed to be trying to justify himself, but he soon
passed on to another theme, and we breathed more freely.</p>

<p class="i2">He had the gift of words and spoke readily and smoothly,
but seemed to prefer narrating to conversing. He told us
of his confinement in the Hauptwerk of the Spássky Police-station
in Petersburg, for his article on the death of Gógol,
and he described how dull it was....</p>

<p class="i2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Tolstoy also narrated, and I liked his stories better: they
were more strongly sketched, often humorous, and always
original. In them much was simple, unexpected and touching....
I. S. Aksákof used to say, with reference to Tolstoy's
gigantic power, that he had 'a bear-like talent,' but I will add
that his soul is as meek 'as a dove,' and as enthusiastic as a
youth; and that the union of those two qualities explains the
new direction he has since taken, a direction which so distressed
Tourgénef.</p>

<p class="i2">An hour before midnight Tourgénef rose.</p>

<p class="i2">'It is time for me to go to the station,' said he.</p>

<p class="i2">We all rose. The railway station was one-and-a-half miles
away, and Count Leo Nikoláyevitch drove with him, to see him
off.</p>

<p>Behrs also writes of the same visit:</p>

<p class="i2">At dinner Tourgénef told many stories, and to the delight of
the younger folk mimicked not only persons, but animals also.
Thus, placing one hand under the other, he depicted a fowl
waddling in the soup, and then imitated a hunting dog at a
loss. As I listened to him and watched his tricks I couldn't
help thinking that he evidently inherited something of the
talent for which one of his ancestors under Peter the Great
enjoyed no little fame.</p>

<p>This was the last summer Behrs, now a young man of
twenty-three, passed with Tolstoy before taking up official
work in the Caucasus. His evidence fully supports that
of others who have seen Tolstoy in contact with children,
peasants or native races: to all of these Tolstoy extends
his charm of comprehension, consideration, and sympathy.</p>

<p>Whenever Tolstoy went out with his gun and his dogs,
Behrs used to accompany him; and together they would
ride twenty-four miles from Yásnaya to visit Count Sergius
Tolstoy at Pirogóvo. Leo Tolstoy took his brother-in-law
on these visits, Behrs says, 'for my sake, if not for
his own, since he knew what pleasure it gave me to be
with him.' The remark he made when he heard that
Behrs had obtained an official appointment in the Caucasus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
is characteristic: 'You are too late for the Caucasus. The
whole country already stinks of officials.' Characteristic
too of the feeling Tolstoy inspires among those who know
him most intimately, is Behrs's concluding remark: 'I at
least am aware of nothing in his life that needs to be concealed.'</p>

<p>At the beginning of September Tourgénef, on his return
from his estate, again visited Yásnaya, but he arrived at an
unfortunate time, when there was illness in the house, and
he paid but a short visit.</p>

<p>One sees by a letter to Fet on 5th September that Tolstoy
still found himself unable to be quite intimate with his
fellow novelist:</p>

<p class="i2">Tourgénef on his return journey came to see us and was
glad to receive your letter. He is still the same, and we know
the degree of nearness possible between us.</p>

<p class="i2">I have a terrible desire to write something, but feel a depressing
doubt whether this is a false or a true appetite.</p>

<p>The last sentence must refer to the <i>Confession</i>, most of
which was not written till the next year.</p>

<p>In October he again wrote to Fet:</p>

<p class="i2">I do not know how or in what spirit to begin to write to you,
dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch; any way, there are no words for
it but, 'I am to blame, I am to blame, and I am altogether to
blame!' Though it is always superfluous for apologisers to
explain their reasons, I will yet write mine because they are
true and explain my condition. For a month past, if not
more, I have been living amid the fumes not of external occurrences
(on the contrary we are by ourselves, living quietly) but
of what is going on inside: something I know not how to name.
I go out shooting, read, reply to questions put to me, eat, and
sleep, but can do nothing, not even write a letter, a score of
which have collected.</p>

<p>Apparently while in bad spirits, he wrote to Tourgénef
asking him not to refer to his (Tolstoy's) writings&mdash;for the
latter replies on 15th October, saying: 'I am glad you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
all physically well, and hope the "mental sickness" of which
you write has now passed.' He then continues:</p>

<p class="i2">Although you ask me not to speak of your writings, I must
still remark that it has never happened to me to laugh at you
'even a little.' Some of your things pleased me very much;
others did not please me at all; while others again, such as
<i>The Cossacks</i> for instance, afforded me great pleasure and
excited my wonder. But what ground was there for laughter?
I thought you had long since got rid of such 'reflexive'
feelings. Why are they current only among authors, and not
among musicians, painters, and other artists? Probably because
in literary work more of that part of the soul is exposed, which
it is not quite convenient to show. But at our (already mature)
age as authors, it is time we were accustomed to it.</p>

<p>This displeased Tolstoy, who in his next letter to Fet
expressed his vexation with Tourgénef who, I imagine, had
not intended to give offence:</p>

<p class="rightm p2"><i>22 November 1878.</i></p>

<p class="i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Afanásy Afanásyevitch</span>,&mdash;I will go to Moscow and
have 'I am to blame' printed on my notepaper. But I don't
think I am to blame for not replying to the letter in which you
promised to come and see us. I remember my joy at that news,
and that I replied immediately. If not, still please don't punish
me, but come....</p>

<p class="i2">Yesterday I received a letter from Tourgénef; and do you
know, I have decided that it will be better to 'keep further
away from him and from sin' [A common Russian saying]. He
is an unpleasant sort of quarrel-maker.</p>

<p class="i2">My congratulations to you on your birthday. I will not in
future omit to congratulate you on the 23rd, and hope not to
forget it for the next dozen times. That will be enough for
either of us. <i>Au revoir!</i></p>

<p>Fet was destined to live four years beyond the span
Tolstoy allotted him, and Tolstoy himself is still with us,
though more than thirty years have passed since that letter
was written; and what strenuous years they have been!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
How he has wrestled with life's greatest problems one after
another, and how he has flung down before the world his
opinions (right, wrong, or motley) on dogmatic theology,
Christ's Christianity, religion in general, economic and social
problems, famine, the employment of violence, war, conscription,
Government, patriotism, the sex problem, art,
science, food-reform and the use of stimulants and narcotics,
besides producing a series of simple stories for the people,
as well as more complex ones for the rest of society, three
plays, one great novel, and a stream of weighty and interesting
essays and letters which have poured forth from Yásnaya
in an increasing stream as the years went by; not to mention
works kept back for posthumous publication, at the mention
of which the literary world pricks up its ears!</p>

<p>On 1st October 1878 Tourgénef wrote to Fet from
Bougival, again saying that he intended to translate <i>The
Cossacks</i> into French, and adding, 'It will give me great
pleasure to assist in acquainting the French public with the
best story that has been written in our language.'</p>

<p>In another letter from Bougival in December, he
remarked:</p>

<p class="i2">I was very glad to come together with Tolstoy, and I spent
three pleasant days with him; his whole family are very
sympathetic, and his wife is charming. He has grown very
quiet and has matured. His name begins to gain European
celebrity: we Russians have long known that he has no
rivals.</p>

<p>The course of the story has swept me a little past
Tolstoy's fiftieth birthday&mdash;the point at which I intended
to close this first part of my work. Besides giving some
brief survey of his writings during his first twenty-five years
of authorship, all that now remains is to give a summary
of that remarkable work, his <i>Confession</i>, which shows us
vividly, though with some amount of involuntary artistic
heightening, what had been going on in his mind and soul
from 1874 to 1879, the year in which it was written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
By way of brief preface to his <i>Confession</i>, it will be in
place to say a few words about two different tendencies
which, each in its own way, influenced Tolstoy. On the
one hand there was the religious life of the people, with all
its Medieval traditions. Tolstoy had only to go a short
walk from his house to reach the highroad, on which pilgrims
going afoot to the shrines of the Saints could always
be met; and he had many a conversation with these pilgrims
at the rest-house they frequented. Among them there
were many to whom the things of this world were certainly
less precious than obedience to the will of God as they
understood it; and Tolstoy's stories show us how closely he
observed these people, and how near some of them came to
his soul. On the other hand he was influenced by the
quite modern and very remarkable movement that was at
this time beginning to make itself felt in Russia; a movement
having its roots in conditions of life which greatly
disturbed Tolstoy's own mind, and which took as one of
its watchwords the motto 'Towards the People'&mdash;a sentiment
quite in harmony with his own attitude.</p>

<p>In 1875 public attention was aroused by the trial of the
Dolgoúshin group of propagandists; and the trial of 'The
Moscow 50,' in March 1877, revealed the fact that a number
of girls of wealthy families were voluntarily leading the life
of factory hands working fourteen hours a day in over-crowded
factories, that they might come into touch with
working people, to teach them, and to carry on a social
and political propaganda among them. Then followed the
historic trial of 'The 193' in 1878.</p>

<p>These and many other indications showed that in spite of
the repressive measures of the Government, a steadily increasing
number of Russians felt (what Tolstoy also felt
strongly) that the existing order of society results in the
mass of the people having to live in conditions of blighting
ignorance and grinding poverty; while the parasitic minority
who live in plenty and sometimes in extravagant superfluity,
render no service at all equivalent to the cost of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
maintenance. The mere statement that those who had
received an education thanks to the work of the masses,
owe service to the masses in return, sufficed to rouse to
action some of the young men and women of that day.
They left their wealthy homes, lived the simplest lives, ran
fearful risks, and according to their lights&mdash;sometimes not
very clear ones&mdash;devoted themselves to the service of the
people.</p>

<p>While this was going on around him, a man with such
a temperament as Tolstoy's, could not be at rest.</p>

<p>Already in 1875 Mihaylóvsky had published a remarkable
series of articles on <i>The Right and Left Hand of Count
Tolstoy</i>, in which he pointed out that that author's works
reveal the clash of contrary ideals and tendencies in the
writer's soul, and that especially his educational articles
contain ideas quite in conflict with certain tendencies
noticeable in <i>War and Peace</i>. With remarkable prevision
Mihaylóvsky predicted an inevitable crisis in Tolstoy's life,
and added:</p>

<p class="i2">One asks oneself what such a man is to do, and how he is to
live?... I think an ordinary man in such a position would end
by suicide or drunkenness; but a man of worth will seek for
other issues&mdash;and of these there are several.</p>

<p>One of these he suggested would be, to write for the people
(Tolstoy's <i>Readers</i> had already been published) or to write so
as to remind 'Society' that its pleasures and amusements
are not those of the mass of mankind, and thus to arouse
the latent feelings of justice in some who now forget the
debt they owe to their fellows.</p>

<p>In fact, the trial of 'The 193' or the movement from
which it arose, had a vital, though indirect, influence on
Tolstoy, who at this time had engaged V. I. Alexéyef,
a graduate of Petersburg University, as mathematical
master for his son. Alexéyef had been a member of the
Tchaykóvsky group which carried on an educational propaganda
in elementary Socialism in the early '70's. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
activities of this group were so restricted, and they were so
hampered by the police, that some of its members, feeling
a need of freer activity, migrated to Kansas, where for two
years they carried on an agricultural colony. Dissensions
arose among them, and their experiment failed. Alexéyef
returned to Russia; Tchaykóvsky settled in England,
where he spent many years, and only returned to Russia
after the amnesty of 1905, to be again arrested and to
spend more than a year in prison awaiting a trial which
ended in his acquittal. Tolstoy noticed that Alexéyef
was a man who shaped his life in accord with his beliefs,
and he respected him accordingly, and through him made
acquaintance with some of the best representatives of
the immature Socialist movement then brewing in Russia.
We have here a remarkable example of the indirect
way in which thoughts influence the world. Auguste
Comte wrote a philosophy. Having filtered through the
minds of G. H. Lewes and J. S. Mill, it reached Nicholas
Tchaykóvsky when he was a schoolboy of fourteen in the
Seventh Gymnasium in Petersburg. 'It fascinated me to
such an extent,' says he in the reminiscences contributed to
G. H. Perris's interesting book, <i>Russia in Revolution</i>, 'that,
while sitting in school, I longed to get back to our lodgings
and to my chosen reading. The more I progressed, the more
I was absorbed. This study powerfully affected my mind
and systematised my ideas.' A few years later Tchaykóvsky,
having read much meanwhile, formed his group, which
sowed the seeds of changes yet to come. Progress, however,
was very slow, and he felt 'the ineffectiveness of ordinary
political and socialistic propaganda among a deeply religious
peasantry, still hopeful of benefits from above.' This
forced him to reconsider the whole situation. 'I met,'
adds he, 'some friends with whom I began to work upon
the rather Utopian idea of formulating a new religion,
and, for the sake of more effective experiment, we were
soon compelled to transfer ourselves with this stupendous
mission, to the steppes of Kansas.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Wishing to transform society, Tchaykóvsky had seen the
need of some systematic outlook on life&mdash;'a new religion,' in
fact. Dissatisfied with his own outlook on life, Tolstoy
was seeking a new religion, and when he found it, it led
him to demand great changes in society. The mature
novelist and the young propagandist, who have never met in
the flesh, had therefore much in common; though Tolstoy
dislikes the works of Comte and Mill, which had done so
much for Tchaykóvsky, and can hardly speak of them with
tolerance (except Mill's <i>Autobiography</i>, which interests him).
Detesting the methods of violence to which those who
succeeded Tchaykóvsky felt themselves driven, Tolstoy could
still not doubt the sincerity of the faith that actuated most
of them; for they had all to lose and nothing to gain by
joining the revolutionary movement. Sophie Peróvsky,
one of 'the 193' (subsequently hanged in Petersburg for
taking part in the assassination of Alexander II), was the
daughter of the Governor-General of that city, and
was a niece of the Minister of Education. Demetrius
Lisogoúb, a landowner, devoted his whole fortune of
some £40,000 to the movement; and was hanged in
Odessa. Prince Peter Kropótkin risked his all to give
lessons to workmen; and escaped abroad, having lost
position, fortune, and the right to live in his native land.
Tolstoy, an older man, with a strong character and
definite views of his own on many points, could not join
the Socialist movement, but that he was influenced by it
is beyond doubt.</p>

<p>The state of Russian life was indeed such that men of sensitive
consciences could not be at rest (as, indeed, when and
where in the wide world can they?), and the work Tolstoy
had already done, marked him out as one in whose soul the
struggle which was moving others, would assuredly be
fought out strenuously. No one however, and certainly not
he himself, as yet knew what effect that crisis would have
upon him, or what his course of life would be in the years
that were to come.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">This</span> chapter is a summary of Tolstoy's <i>Confession</i>,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> or
'Introduction to a Criticism of Dogmatic Theology and to
an Investigation of the Christian Teachings,' as the Russian
title ran, from the first pages of which I have already quoted
freely in the preceding chapters. I have kept as much to
Tolstoy's words as possible, but having to condense, I have
not only omitted much, but have also paraphrased some
passages to avoid repetition. The plan I have adopted,
since this is a <i>Life</i> and not a theological treatise, has been
to cut down to a mere skeleton the abstract argument of
Tolstoy's <i>Confession</i>, while giving almost in full what he
says about his own experience.</p>

<p>Many men, at the age of puberty, or at any rate while
their minds were still maturing, have experienced the change
known as 'Conversion.' That is to say, they have more or
less suddenly turned round and looked at life from a fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
point of view: what in their nature had been latent or
secondary has become dominant and primary, and things
temporal and material have become subordinate to things
spiritual and eternal.</p>

<p>What is unusual about the story of Tolstoy's conversion
is that it came so late in life and so gradually, and that
the intellect played so large a part in it.</p>

<p>Some men take to religion at the prompting of the heart,
others at the prompting of the brain; and Tolstoy belongs to
the latter category, not from lack of heart, but because strong
as are his emotions, his intellectual power is stronger still.</p>

<p>His <i>Confession</i> was written in 1879, and in it he says:</p>

<p>Five years ago something very strange began to happen
to me: At first I experienced moments of perplexity and
arrest of life, as though I did not know how to live or what
to do; and I felt lost and became dejected. But this passed,
and I went on living as before. Then these moments of
perplexity began to recur oftener and oftener, and always
in the same form. They were always expressed by the
questions: What's it for? What does it lead to?</p>

<p>At first it seemed to me that these were aimless and
irrelevant questions. I thought that it was all well known,
and that if I should ever wish to deal with the solution, it
would not cost me much effort; just at present I had no
time for it, but when I wanted to I should be able to find
the answer. The questions, however, began to repeat themselves
frequently, and more and more insistently to demand
replies; and like drops of ink always falling on one place,
they ran together into one black blot.</p>

<p>That occurred which happens to every one sickening with
a mortal internal disease. At first trivial signs of indisposition
appear, to which the sick man pays no attention;
then these signs reappear more and more often, and merge
into one uninterrupted period of suffering. The suffering
increases, and before the sick man can look round, what he
took for a mere indisposition has already become more important
to him than anything else in the world&mdash;it is death!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
That was what happened to me. I understood that it
was no casual indisposition, but something very important,
and that if these questions constantly repeated themselves,
it would be necessary to answer them. And I tried to do
so. The questions seemed such stupid simple childish
questions; but as soon as I touched them and tried to solve
them, I at once became convinced (1) that they are not
childish and stupid, but the most important and the deepest
of life's questions; and (2) that, try as I would, I could not
solve them. Before occupying myself with my Samára
estate, the education of my son, or the writing of a book,
I had to know <i>why</i> I was doing it. As long as I did not
know why, I could do nothing, and could not live. Amid
the thoughts of estate management which greatly occupied
me at that time, the question would suddenly occur to me:
'Well, you will have 16,000 acres of land in Samára Government
and 300 horses, and what next?'... And I was
quite disconcerted, and did not know what to think. Or,
when considering my plans for the education of my children,
I would say to myself: What for? Or when considering
how the peasants might be prosperous, I suddenly said to
myself, 'But what business is it of mine?' Or when thinking
of the fame my works would bring me, I said to myself,
'Very well: you will be more famous than Gógol or
Poúshkin or Shakespear or Molière, or than all the writers
in the world&mdash;and what will it lead to?' And I could
find no reply at all. The questions would not wait, they
had to be answered at once, and if I did not answer them, it
was impossible to live. But there was no answer.</p>

<p>I felt that what I had been standing on had broken down,
and that I had nothing left under my feet. What I had
lived on, no longer existed; and I had nothing left to live on.</p>

<p>My life came to a standstill. I could breathe, eat, drink
and sleep, and I could not help doing these things; but
there was no life, for there were no wishes the fulfilment of
which I could consider reasonable.... Had a fairy come
and offered to fulfil my desires, I should not have known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
what to ask.... If in moments of intoxication I felt
something which I cannot call a wish, but a habit left by
former wishes, in sober moments I knew this to be a
delusion, and that there is really nothing to wish for. I
could not even wish to know the truth, for I guessed in
what it consisted. The truth was that life is meaningless.
I had, as it were, lived, lived, and walked, walked, till I had
come to a precipice and saw clearly that there was nothing
ahead of me but destruction. It was impossible to stop,
impossible to go back, and impossible to close my eyes or
avoid seeing that there was nothing ahead but suffering and
real death&mdash;complete annihilation.</p>

<p>It had come to this, that I, a healthy, fortunate man, felt I
could no longer live: some irresistible power impelled me to
rid myself one way or other of life. I cannot say I <i>wished</i> to
kill myself. The power which drew me away from life was
stronger, fuller, and more widespread than any mere wish.</p>

<p>The thought of self-destruction now came to me as
naturally as thoughts of how to improve my life had come
formerly. And it was so seductive that I had to be wily
with myself, lest I should carry it out too hastily: 'If I
cannot unravel matters, there will always be time.' And it
was then that I, a man favoured by fortune, hid a cord
from myself, lest I should hang myself from the crosspiece
of the partition in my room, where I undressed alone every
evening; and I ceased to go out shooting with a gun, lest
I should be tempted by so easy a way of ending my life.
I did not myself know what I wanted: I feared life, desired
to escape from it; yet still hoped something of it.</p>

<p>And all this befell me at a time when all around me I
had what is considered complete good fortune. I was not
yet fifty; I had a good wife who loved me and whom I
loved; good children, and a large estate which without much
effort on my part improved and increased. I was respected
by my relations and acquaintances more than at any previous
time. I was praised by others, and without much self-deception
could consider that my name was famous. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
far from being insane or mentally unwell,&mdash;on the contrary
I enjoyed a strength of mind and body such as I have
seldom met with among men of my kind: physically I
could keep up with the peasants at mowing, and mentally
I could work for eight to ten hours at a stretch without
experiencing any ill results from such exertion....</p>

<p>My mental condition presented itself to me in this way:
my life is a stupid and spiteful joke some one has played
on me. Though I did not acknowledge a 'some one' who
created me, yet that form of representation&mdash;that some one
had played an evil and stupid joke on me by placing me
in the world&mdash;was the form of expression that suggested
itself most naturally to me.</p>

<p>Involuntarily it appeared to me that there, somewhere,
is some one who amuses himself by watching how I live for
thirty or forty years: learning, developing, maturing in
body and mind, and how&mdash;having now with matured mental
powers reached the summit of life, from which it all lies
before me, I stand on that summit&mdash;like an arch-fool&mdash;seeing
clearly that there is nothing in life, and that there
has been and will be nothing. And he is amused....</p>

<p>But whether that 'some one' laughing at me existed or not,
I was none the better off. I could give no reasonable meaning
to any single action, or to my whole life. I was only
surprised that I could have avoided understanding this from
the very beginning&mdash;it has been so long known to all. To-day
or to-morrow sickness and death will come (they have
come already) to those I love or to me; nothing will remain
but stench and worms. Sooner or later my deeds, whatever
they may have been, will be forgotten, and I shall not exist.
Then why go on making any effort?... How can man
fail to see this? And how go on living? That is what is
surprising! One can only live when one is intoxicated with
life; as soon as one is sober it is impossible not to see that
it is all a mere fraud and a stupid fraud! That is precisely
what it is: there is nothing either amusing or witty about
it; it is simply cruel and stupid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
There is an Eastern fable, told long ago, of a traveller
overtaken on a plain by an enraged beast. Escaping from
the beast he leaps into a dry well, but sees at the bottom of
the well a dragon that has opened its jaws to swallow him.
And the unfortunate man, not daring to climb out lest he
should be destroyed by the enraged beast, and not daring
to leap to the bottom of the well lest he should be eaten by
the dragon, seizes a twig growing in a crack in the well and
clings to it. His hands are growing weaker, and he feels he
will soon have to resign himself to the destruction that
awaits him above or below; but still he clings on; and he
sees that two mice, a black and a white one, go regularly
round and round the stem of the twig to which he is
clinging, and gnaw at it. And soon the twig itself will
snap and he will fall into the dragon's jaws. The traveller
sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish; but
while still hanging he looks around and finds some drops
of honey on the leaves of the twig and reaches them with
his tongue and licks them. So I too clung to the twig of
life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting
me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand
why I had fallen into such torment. I tried to
lick the honey which formerly consoled me; but the honey
no longer gave me pleasure, and the white and black mice
of day and night gnawed at the branch by which I hung.
I saw the dragon clearly, and the honey no longer tasted
sweet. And this is not a fable, but the real unanswerable
truth intelligible to all.</p>

<p>The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed
my terror of the dragon, now no longer deceives me. No
matter how much I may be told: 'You cannot understand
the meaning of life, so do not think about it, but live,'
I can no longer do it: I have already done it too long.
I cannot now help seeing day and night going round and
bringing me to death. That is all I see, for that alone
is true. All else is false.</p>

<p>The two drops of honey which diverted my eyes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
the cruel truth longer than the rest: my love of family, and
of writing&mdash;art as I called it&mdash;were no longer sweet to me.</p>

<p>Family ... said I to myself. But my family: wife and
children&mdash;are also human. They too are placed as I am:
they must either live in a lie, or see the terrible truth.
Why should they live? Why should I love them, guard
them, bring them up, or watch them? That they may come
to the despair that I feel, or else be stupid? Loving them,
I cannot hide the truth from them: each step in knowledge
leads them to that truth. And the truth is death.</p>

<p>'Art, poetry?'... Under the influence of success and
the praise of men, I had long assured myself that this was
a thing one could do though death was drawing near&mdash;death
which destroys all things, including my work and its
remembrance; but I soon saw that that too was a fraud.
It was plain to me that art is an adornment to life, an
allurement to life. But life had lost its attraction for me;
so how could I attract others? As long as I was not living
my own life, but was borne on the waves of some other life&mdash;as
long as I believed that life had a meaning, though one
I could not express&mdash;the reflection of life in poetry and art
of all kinds, afforded me pleasure: it was pleasant to look
at life in the mirror of art. But when I began to seek the
meaning of life, and felt the necessity of living on my own
account, that mirror became for me unnecessary, superfluous,
ridiculous, or painful. I could no longer soothe myself with
what I saw in the mirror, for what I saw was, that my
position was stupid and desperate. It was all very well to
enjoy the sight when in the depth of my soul I believed
that my life had a meaning. Then the play of lights&mdash;comic,
tragic, touching, beautiful and terrible&mdash;in life,
amused me. But when I knew life to be meaningless and
terrible, the play in the mirror could no longer amuse me.
No sweetness of honey could be sweet to me when I saw
the dragon, and saw the mice gnawing away my support.</p>

<p>Nor was that all. Had I simply understood that life has
no meaning, I could have borne it quietly, knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
that was my lot. But I could not satisfy myself with that.
Had I been like a man living in a wood from which he
knows there is no exit, I could have lived; but I was like
one lost in a wood who, horrified at having lost his way,
rushes about, wishing to find the road, yet knows that each
step he takes confuses him more and more; and still cannot
help rushing about.</p>

<p>It was indeed terrible. And to rid myself of the terror, I
wished to kill myself. I experienced terror at what awaited
me&mdash;knew that that terror was even worse than the position
I was in; but still I could not patiently await the end.
However convincing the argument might be that, in any
case, some vessel in my heart would give way, or something
would burst and all would be over, I could not patiently
await that end. The horror of darkness was too great, and
I wished to free myself from it as quickly as possible by
noose or bullet. That was the feeling which drew me most
strongly towards suicide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'But perhaps I have overlooked something, or misunderstood
something? It cannot be that this condition of despair
is natural to man!' thought I, and as a perishing man
seeks safety, I sought some way of escape.</p>

<p>I sought everywhere; and thanks to a life spent in learning,
and thanks also to the relations I had with the scholarly
world, I had access to scientists and scholars in all branches
of knowledge, and they readily showed me all their knowledge,
not only in books, but also in conversation, so that
I had at my disposal all that knowledge has to say on this
question of life....</p>

<p>The question which at the age of fifty brought me to the
verge of suicide, was the simplest of questions lying in the
soul of every man, from the foolish child to the wisest elder:
it was a question without answering which one cannot live, as
I had found by experience. It was, What will come of what
I am doing to-day or shall do to-morrow&mdash;What will come
of my whole life?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>Differently expressed, the question is: Why should I live,
why wish for anything, or do anything? It can also be expressed
thus: Is there any meaning in life, that the inevitable
death awaiting one, does not destroy? All human
knowledge I found divided into two kinds. One kind, such
as chemistry and mathematics and the exact sciences, did
not deal with my question. They were interesting, attractive,
and wonderfully definite, but made no attempt to
solve the question; while on the other hand the speculative
sciences, culminating in metaphysics, dealt with the question,
but supplied no satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>Where philosophy does not lose sight of the essential
question, its answer is always one and the same: an answer
given by Socrates, Schopenhauer, Solomon and Buddha.</p>

<p>'We approach truth only inasmuch as we depart from
life,' said Socrates when preparing for death. 'For what do
we who love truth, strive after in life? To free ourselves
from the body, and from all the evil that is caused by the
body! If so, then how can we fail to be glad when death
comes to us?'</p>

<p>'The wise man seeks death all his life, and therefore does
not fear death.'</p>

<p>And Schopenhauer also says that life is an evil; and
Solomon (or whoever wrote the works attributed to him)
says:</p>

<p>'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. What profit hath man
of all his labour under the sun?... There is no remembrance
of former things, neither shall there be any remembrance
of things that are to come, with those that shall
come after....</p>

<p>'Therefore I hated life, because the work that is wrought
under the sun is grievous to me; for all is vanity and vexation
of spirit.'</p>

<p>And Sakya Muni when he learnt what age and sickness
and death are, could find no consolation in life, and decided
that life is the greatest of evils; and he devoted all the
strength of his soul to free himself from it, and to free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
others; and to do this so that even after death life shall not
be renewed any more, but be completely destroyed at its
very roots. So speaks all the wisdom of India.</p>

<p>These then are the direct replies that human wisdom
gives, when it replies to the question of life:</p>

<p>'The life of the body is an evil and a lie. Therefore the
destruction of the life of the body is a blessing, and we
should desire it,' says Socrates.</p>

<p>'Life is that which should not be&mdash;an evil; and the
passage into Nothingness is the only good in life,' says
Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>'All that is in the world: folly and wisdom and riches
and poverty and mirth and grief&mdash;are vanity and emptiness.
Man dies and nothing is left of him. And that is stupid,'
says Solomon.</p>

<p>'To live in the consciousness of the inevitability of suffering,
of becoming enfeebled, of old age and of death, is
impossible&mdash;we must free ourselves from life, from all possible
life,' says Buddha.</p>

<p>And what these strong minds said, has been said and
thought and felt by millions upon millions of people like
them. And I have thought it and felt it.</p>

<p>One cannot deceive oneself. It is all&mdash;vanity! Happy is
he who has not been born: death is better than life, and one
must free oneself from life.</p>

<p>Then I began to consider the lives of the men of my own
kind; and I found that they met the problem in one or
other of four ways.</p>

<p>The first way was that of ignorance. Some people&mdash;mostly
women, or very young or very dull people&mdash;have not
yet understood the question of life; but I, having understood
it, could not again shut my eyes.</p>

<p>The second way was that of the Epicureans, expressed by
Solomon when he said: 'Then I commended mirth, because
a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and
to drink, and to be merry.'</p>

<p>That is the way in which the majority of people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
our circle make life possible for themselves. Their circumstances
furnish them with more of welfare than of hardship,
and their moral dullness makes it possible for them to
forget that the advantage of their position is an accidental
advantage, and that not every one can have a thousand
wives and a thousand palaces like Solomon, and that for
every man with a thousand wives there are a thousand without
wives, and that for each palace there are a thousand
people who have to build it in the sweat of their brows; and
that the accident that has to-day made me a Solomon, may
to-morrow make me Solomon's slave. The dullness of these
people's imaginations enables them to forget what gave
no peace to Buddha&mdash;the inevitability of sickness, age and
death, which to-day or to-morrow will destroy all these
pleasures. I could not imitate these people: I had not
their dullness of imagination, and I could not artificially
produce it in myself.</p>

<p>The third escape is that of strength and energy. It consists
in understanding that life is an evil and an absurdity,
and in destroying it. It is a way adopted by a few exceptionally
strong and consistent people. I saw that it was
the worthiest way of escape, and I wished to adopt it.</p>

<p>The fourth escape is that of weakness. It consists in
seeing the truth of the situation, and yet clinging to life
as though one still hoped something from it; and I found
myself in that category.</p>

<p>To live like Solomon and Schopenhauer, knowing that life
is a stupid joke played upon us, and still to go on living:
washing oneself, dressing, dining, talking and even writing
books, was to me repulsive and tormenting, but I remained
in that position.</p>

<p>I now see that if I did not kill myself, it was due to some
dim consciousness of the invalidity of my thoughts. And
I began to feel, rather than argue, in this way: 'I, my
reason, has acknowledged life to be unreasonable. If there
be no higher reason (and there is not: nothing can prove
that there is) then reason is the creator of life for me. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
reason did not exist, there would be for me no life. How
can reason deny life, when it is the creator of life? Or to
put it the other way: were there no life, my reason would
not exist; therefore reason is life's son. Life is all. Reason
is its fruit, yet reason denies life itself!' I felt that there
was something wrong here.</p>

<p>Nothing prevents our denying life by suicide. Well then,
kill yourself, and cease discussing. If life displeases you,
kill yourself! You live, and cannot understand the meaning
of life&mdash;then finish it; and do not fool about in life, saying
and writing that you do not understand it. You have come
into good company, where people are contented and like
what they are doing: if you find it dull and repulsive&mdash;go
away!</p>

<p>Indeed, what are we who are convinced of the necessity of
suicide yet do not decide to commit it, but the weakest,
most inconsistent, and to put it plainly, the stupidest of
men, fussing about with our own stupidity as a fool fusses
about with a painted hussy?</p>

<p>'There is something wrong,' said I to myself; but what
was wrong, I could in no way make out. It was long before
the fog began to clear, and I began to be able to restate my
position.</p>

<p>It had seemed to me that the narrow circle of rich learned
and leisured people to whom I belonged, formed the whole
of humanity, and that the milliards of others who have lived
and are living, were cattle of some sort&mdash;not real people....
And it was long before it dawned upon me to ask: 'But
what meaning is, and has been, given to their lives by all the
milliards of common folk who live and have lived in the
world?'</p>

<p>I long lived in this state of lunacy, which in fact if not in
words is particularly characteristic of us Liberal and learned
people. But whether the strange physical affection I have
for the real labouring people compelled me to understand
them and to see that they are not so stupid as we suppose;
or whether it was due to the sincerity of my conviction that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
I could know nothing beyond the fact that the best I could
do was to hang myself, at any rate I instinctively felt that
if I wished to live and understand the meaning of life,
I must seek this meaning not among those who have lost
it and wish to kill themselves, but among those milliards of
the past and the present who know it, and who support
the burden of their own lives and of ours also.</p>

<p>And on examining the matter I saw that the milliards of
mankind always have had and still have a knowledge of the
meaning of life, but <i>that</i> knowledge is their faith, which
I could not but reject. 'It is God, one and three, the
creation in six days, the devils and angels, and all the rest
that I cannot accept as long as I retain my reason,' said I to
myself.</p>

<p>My position was terrible. I knew I could find nothing
along the path of reasonable knowledge, except a denial of
life; and in faith I could find nothing but a denial of reason,
still more impossible to me than a denial of life.</p>

<p>Finally I saw that my mistake lay in ever expecting an
examination of finite things to supply a meaning to life.
The finite has no ultimate meaning apart from the infinite.
The two must be linked together before an answer to life's
problems can be reached.</p>

<p>It had only appeared to me that knowledge gave a definite
answer&mdash;Schopenhauer's answer: that life has no meaning,
and is an evil. On examining the matter further, I understood
that the reply is not positive: it was only my feeling
that made it seem so. The reply, strictly expressed as the
Brahmins and Solomon and Schopenhauer express it, amounts
only to an indefinite answer, like the reply given in mathematics
when instead of solving an equation we find we
have solved an identity: X = X, or 0 = 0. The answer is,
that life is nothing. So that philosophic knowledge merely
asserts that it cannot solve the question, and the solution
remains, as far as it is concerned, indefinite. And I understood,
further, that however unreasonable and monstrous
might be the replies given by faith, they had this advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
that they introduce into each reply a relation between the
finite and the infinite, without which relation no reply is
possible.</p>

<p>Whichever way I put the question, that relation appeared
in the answer. How am I to live?&mdash;According to the law of
God. What real result will come of my life?&mdash;Eternal
torment or eternal bliss. What meaning has life, that
death does not destroy?&mdash;Union with the eternal God:
heaven.</p>

<p>Faith still remained to me as irrational as it was before,
but I could not but admit that it alone gives mankind a
reply to the questions of life; and that consequently it makes
life possible.</p>

<p>Where there is life, there, since man began, faith has
made life possible for him; and the chief outline of that
faith is everywhere and always one and the same. Faith
does not consist in agreeing with what some one has said, as
is usually supposed; faith is a knowledge of the meaning of
human life in consequence of which man does not destroy
himself, but lives. Faith is the strength of life. If a man
lives he believes in something. If he does not see and
recognise the visionary nature of the finite, then he
believes in the finite; if he understands the visionary nature
of the finite, he must believe in the infinite. Without faith
he cannot live.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What am I?&mdash;A part of the infinite. In those few words
lies the whole problem.</p>

<p>I began dimly to understand that in the replies given by
faith, is stored up the deepest human wisdom.</p>

<p>I understood this; but it made matters no better for me.</p>

<p>I was now ready to accept any faith, if only it did not
demand of me a direct denial of reason&mdash;which would be a
falsehood. And I studied Buddhism and Mohammedanism
from books, and most of all, I studied Christianity both from
books and from living people.</p>

<p>Naturally I first of all turned to the Orthodox of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
circle, to people who were learned: to Church theologians,
the monks, to the theologians of the newest shade, and even
to the Evangelicals<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> who profess salvation by belief in the
Redemption. And I seized on these believers and questioned
them as to their beliefs, and their understanding of the
meaning of life.</p>

<p>But in spite of my readiness to make all possible concessions,
I saw that what they gave out as their faith did
not explain the meaning of life, but obscured it.</p>

<p>I remember the painful feeling of fear of being thrown
back into my former state of despair, after the hope I often
and often experienced in my intercourse with these people.</p>

<p>The more fully they explained to me their doctrines, the
more clearly did I see their error.... It was not that in
their doctrines they mixed many unnecessary and unreasonable
things with the Christian truths that had always
been near to me: that was not what repelled me. I was
repelled by the fact that these people's lives were like my
own, with only this difference&mdash;that such a life did not
correspond to the principles they expounded in their
teachings.</p>

<p>No arguments could convince me of the truth of their
faith. Only deeds which showed that they saw a meaning
in life, which made what was so dreadful to me&mdash;poverty
sickness and death&mdash;not dreadful to them, could convince
me. And such deeds I did not see among the various
bodies of believers in our circle. On the contrary, I saw
such deeds done by people of our circle who were the
most unbelieving, but never by the so-called believers of our
circle.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>And I understood that the belief of these people was not
the faith I sought, and that their faith is not a real faith,
but an Epicurean consolation in life.</p>

<p>And I began to draw near to the believers among the
poor simple unlettered folk: pilgrims, monks, sectarians and
peasants. Among them, too, I found a great deal of superstition
mixed with the Christian truths; but their superstitions
seemed a necessary and natural part of their lives....
And I began to look well into the life and faith of
these people, and the more I considered it, the more I
became convinced that they have a real faith, which is a
necessity to them and alone gives their life a meaning and
makes it possible for them to live.... In contrast with what
I had seen in our circle, where the whole of life is passed in
idleness and amusements and dissatisfaction, I saw that the
whole life of these people was passed in heavy labour, and
that they were content with life.... While we think it
terrible that we have to suffer and die, these folk live and
suffer, and approach death with tranquillity, and in most
cases gladly.</p>

<p>And I learnt to love these people. The more I came to
know their life the more I loved them, and the easier it
became for me to live. So I went on for about two years,
and a change took place in me which had long been preparing,
and the promise of which had always been in me. The
life of our circle, the rich and learned, not merely became
distasteful to me but lost all meaning for me; while the
life of the whole labouring people, the whole of mankind
who produce life, appeared to me in its true light. I
understood that <i>that</i> is life itself, and that the meaning
given to that life is true; and I accepted it.</p>

<p>I then understood that my answer to the question, 'What
is life?' when I said that life is 'evil,' was quite correct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
The only mistake was, that that answer referred to <i>my</i> life,
but not to life in general. My life, a life of indulgence and
desires, was meaningless and evil.... And I understood
the truth, which I afterwards found in the Gospels, that
men love darkness rather than the light because their deeds
are evil; and that to see things as they are, one must think
and speak of the life of humanity, and not of the life of the
minority who are parasites on life.</p>

<p>And indeed, the bird lives so that it must fly, collect food
and build its nest; and when I see the bird doing that, I
joy in its joy. The goat, hare and wolf live so that they
must feed themselves, and propagate and feed their families,
and when they do so, I feel firmly assured that they are
happy and that their life is a reasonable one. And what
does man do? He should earn a living as the beasts do,
but with this difference&mdash;that he would perish if he did it
alone; he has to procure it not for himself but for all.
When he does <i>that</i>, I have a firm assurance that he is happy
and that his life is reasonable. And what had I done
during the whole thirty years of my conscious life? I had
not only not been earning a living for all, I had not even
earned my own living. I had lived as a parasite, and when
I asked myself what use my life was, I found that my life
was useless. If the meaning of human life lies in supporting
it, how could I, who for thirty years had occupied
myself not with supporting life but with destroying it in
myself and in others&mdash;how could I obtain any other reply
than that my life was senseless and an evil? It was both
senseless and evil.</p>

<p>The conviction that a knowledge of life can only be found
by living, led me to doubt the goodness of my own life....
During that whole year, when I was asking myself almost
every moment, whether I should not end matters with a
noose or a bullet&mdash;all that time, alongside the course of
thought and observation about which I have spoken, my
heart was oppressed with a painful feeling which I can only
describe as a search for God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>I went over in my mind the arguments of Kant and
Schopenhauer showing the impossibility of proving the
existence of a God, and I began to refute them. Cause,
said I to myself, is not a category such as are Time and
Space. If I exist, there must be some cause for it, and a
cause of causes. And that first cause of all, is what men
have called 'God.' And as soon as I acknowledged that
there is a force in whose power I am, I at once felt that I
could live. But I asked myself: What is that cause, that
force? How am I to think of it? What are my relations
to that which I call 'God'? And only the familiar replies
occurred to me: 'He is the Creator and Preserver.' This
reply did not satisfy me, and I felt I was losing within me
what I needed for my life. I became terrified and began to
pray to him whom I sought, that he should help me. But
the more I prayed the more apparent it became to me that
he did not hear me, and that there was no one to whom to
address myself. And with despair in my heart that there
is no God at all, I said: 'Lord, have mercy, save me!
Lord, teach me!' But no one had mercy on me, and I felt
that my life was coming to a standstill.</p>

<p>But again and again I returned to the same admission
that I could not have come into the world without any cause
or reason or meaning; I could not be such a fledgling fallen
from its nest as I felt myself to be. Or, granting that I be
such, lying on my back in the high grass, even then I cry
because I know that a mother has borne me within her, has
hatched me, warmed me, fed me and loved me. Where is
she&mdash;that mother? If she has deserted me, who is it that
has done so? I cannot hide from myself that some one
bore me, loving me. Who was that some one? Again
'God'?</p>

<p>'He exists,' said I to myself. And I had only for an
instant to admit that, and at once life rose within me, and
I felt the possibility and joy of being. But again, from the
admission of the existence of a God I went on to seek my
relations with him; and again I imagined <i>that</i> God&mdash;our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
creator in three persons who sent his son, the Saviour&mdash;and
again <i>that</i> God, detached from the world and from me,
melts like a block of ice, melts before my eyes, and again
nothing remains, and again the spring of life dries up
within me, and I despair, and feel that I have nothing to
do but to kill myself. And the worst of all is, that I feel
I cannot do it.</p>

<p>Not twice or three times, but tens and hundreds of times,
I reached those conditions first of joy and animation,
and then of despair and consciousness of the impossibility
of living.</p>

<p>I remember that it was in early spring: I was alone in
the wood listening to its sounds. I listened and thought
ever of the same thing, as I had constantly done during
those last three years. I was again seeking God.</p>

<p>'Very well, there is no God,' said I to myself; 'there is
no one who is not my imagination but a reality like my
whole life. He does not exist, and no miracles can prove
his existence, because the miracles would be my perceptions,
besides being irrational.'</p>

<p>'But my <i>perception</i> of God, of him whom I seek,' asked I
of myself, 'where has that perception come from?' And
again at this thought the glad waves of life rose within me.
All that was around me came to life, and received a meaning.
But my joy did not last long. My mind continued
its work.</p>

<p>'The conception of God, is not God,' said I to myself.
'The conception, is what takes place within me. The conception
of God, is something I can evoke or can refrain from
evoking in myself. That is not what I seek. I seek that,
without which there can be no life.' And again all around
me and within me began to die, and again I wished to kill
myself.</p>

<p>But then I turned my gaze upon myself, on what went on
within me, and I remembered that I only lived at those
times when I believed in God. As it was before, so it was
now; I need only be aware of God to live; I need only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
forget him, or disbelieve in him, and I die.... 'What
more do you seek?' exclaimed a voice within me. 'This is
he. He is that without which one cannot live. To know
God and to live is one and the same thing. God is life.
Live seeking God, and then you will not live without God.'
And more than ever before, all within me and around me
lit up, and the light did not again abandon me.</p>

<p>And I was saved from suicide.... And strange to say, the
strength of life which returned to me was not new, but quite
old&mdash;the same that had borne me along in my earliest days.</p>

<p>I quite returned to what belonged to my earliest childhood
and youth. I returned to the belief in that Will
which produced me, and desires something of me. I
returned to the belief that the chief and only aim of my life
is to be better, <i>i.e.</i> to live in accord with that Will. And
I returned to the belief that I can find the expression of
that Will, in what humanity, in the distant past hidden
from me, has produced for its guidance: that is to say, I
returned to a belief in God, in moral perfecting, and in a
tradition transmitting the meaning of life....</p>

<p>I turned from the life of our circle: acknowledging that
theirs is not life but only a simulacrum of life, and that the
conditions of superfluity in which we live deprive us of the
possibility of understanding life.... The simple labouring
people around me were the Russian people, and I turned to
them and to the meaning which they give to life. That
meaning, if one can put it into words, was the following.
Every man has come into this world by the will of God.
And God has so made man that every man can destroy his
soul or save it. The aim of man in life is to save his soul;
and to save his soul he must live 'godly,' and to live 'godly'
he must renounce all the pleasures of life, must labour,
humble himself, suffer and be merciful.... The meaning
of this was clear and near to my heart. But together with
this meaning of the popular faith of our non-sectarian folk
among whom I live, much was inseparably bound up that
revolted me and seemed to me inexplicable: sacraments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Church services, fasts, and the adoration of relics and icons.
The people cannot separate the one from the other, nor
could I. And strange as much of it was to me, I accepted
everything; and attended the services, knelt morning and
evening in prayer, fasted, and prepared to receive the
eucharist; and at first my reason did not resist anything.
What had formerly seemed to me impossible, did not now
evoke in me any resistance....</p>

<p>I told myself that the essence of every faith consists in
its giving life a meaning which death does not destroy.
Naturally, for a faith to be able to reply to the questions
of a king dying in luxury, of an old slave tormented by
overwork, and of all sorts of people, young and old, wise
and foolish,&mdash;its answers must be expressed in all sorts of
different ways.... But this argument, justifying in my
eyes the queerness of much on the ritual side of religion,
did not suffice to allow me, in the one great affair of life&mdash;religion&mdash;to
do things which seemed to me questionable.
With all my soul I wished to be in a position to mingle
with the people, fulfilling the ritual side of their religion;
but I could not do it. I felt that I should lie to myself,
and mock at what was sacred to me, were I to do so. At
this point, however, our new Russian theological writers
came to my rescue.</p>

<p>According to the explanation these theologians gave, the
fundamental dogma of our faith is the infallibility of the
Church. From the admission of that dogma follows inevitably
the truth of all that is professed by the Church.
The Church as an assembly of true-believers united by love,
and therefore possessed of true knowledge, became the basis
of my belief. I told myself that divine truth cannot be
accessible to a separate individual; it is revealed only to
the whole assembly of people united by love. To attain
truth one must not separate; and not to separate, one must
love and must endure things one may not agree with.</p>

<p>Truth reveals itself to love, and if you do not submit to
the rites of the Church, you transgress against love; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
by transgressing against love you deprive yourself of the
possibility of recognising the truth. I did not then see the
sophistry contained in this argument. I did not see that
union in love may give the greatest love, but certainly
cannot give us divine truth expressed in the definite words
of the Nicene Creed. I also did not perceive that love
cannot make a certain expression of truth an obligatory
condition of union. I did not then see these mistakes in
the argument, and thanks to it, was able to accept and perform
all the rites of the Orthodox Church without understanding
most of them.</p>

<p>When fulfilling the rites of the Church I humbled my
reason, submitted to tradition, united myself with my forefathers:
the father, mother and grandparents I loved, and
with all those millions of the common people whom I
respected. When rising before dawn for the early Church
services, I knew I was doing well, if only because I was
sacrificing my bodily ease to humble my mental pride, and
for the sake of finding the meaning of life. However insignificant
these sacrifices might be, I made them for the sake
of something good. I fasted, prepared for communion, and
observed the fixed hours of prayer at home and in church.
During Church service I attended to every word, and gave
them a meaning whenever I could.</p>

<p>But this reading of meanings into the rites had its
limits.... If I explained to myself the frequent repetition
of prayers for the Tsar and his relatives, by the fact
that they are more exposed to temptation than other
people and therefore more in need of being prayed for,
the prayers about subduing enemies and foes under his
feet (even though one tried to say that sin was the foe
prayed against) and many other unintelligible prayers&mdash;nearly
two-thirds of the whole service&mdash;either remained
quite incomprehensible or, when I forced an explanation
into them, made me feel that I was lying, and thereby
quite destroying my relation to God and losing all possibility
of believing....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>Never shall I forget the painful feeling I experienced the
day I received the eucharist for the first time after many
years. The service, confession and prayers were quite
intelligible and produced in me a glad consciousness that
the meaning of life was being revealed to me. The communion
itself I explained as an act performed in remembrance
of Christ, and indicating a purification from sin and
the full acceptance of Christ's teaching. If that explanation
was artificial I did not notice its artificiality: so happy was
I at humbling and abasing myself before the priest&mdash;a
simple timid country clergyman&mdash;turning all the dirt out
of my soul and confessing my vices, so glad was I to merge
in thought with the humility of the Fathers who wrote the
prayers of the Office, so glad was I of union with all who
have believed and now believe, that I did not notice the
artificiality of my explanation. But when I approached the
altar gates, and the priest made me say that I believed that
what I was about to swallow was truly flesh and blood, I felt
a pain in my heart: it was not merely a false note, it was a
cruel demand made by some one or other who evidently had
never known what faith is.</p>

<p>I now permit myself to say that it was a cruel demand,
but I did not then think so: only it was indescribably
painful to me. At the time, I found in my soul a feeling
which helped me to endure it. This was the feeling of
self-abasement and humility. I humbled myself, swallowed
that flesh and blood without any blasphemous feelings,
and with a wish to believe. But the blow had been struck,
and knowing what awaited me, I could not go a second
time.</p>

<p>I continued to fulfil the rites of the Church and still
believed that the doctrine I was following contained the
truth, when something happened to me which I now
understand but which then seemed strange.</p>

<p>I was listening to the conversation of an illiterate peasant,
a pilgrim, about God, faith, life and salvation, when a
knowledge of faith revealed itself to me. I drew near to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the people, listening to their opinions on life and faith, and
I understood the truth. So also was it when I read the Lives
of the Saints, which became my favourite books. Putting
aside the miracles, and regarding them as fables illustrating
thoughts, this reading revealed to me life's meaning. There
were the lives of Makarius the Great, of the Tsarévitch
Joasafa (the story of Buddha) and there were the stories
of the traveller in the well, and the monk who found some
gold. There were stories of the martyrs, all announcing
that death does not exclude life; and there were
the stories of ignorant, stupid men, and such as knew
nothing of the teaching of the Church, but who yet were
saved.</p>

<p>But as soon as I met learned believers, or took up their
books, doubt of myself, dissatisfaction, and exasperated
disputation, were roused within me, and I felt that the more
I entered into the meaning of these men's speech, the more
I went astray from truth and approached an abyss. How
often I envied the peasants their illiteracy and lack of
learning! Those statements in the creeds, which to me
were evident absurdities, for them contained nothing false.
Only to me, unhappy man, was it clear that with truth
falsehood was interwoven by finest threads, and that I could
not accept it in that form.</p>

<p>So I lived for about three years. At first, when I did
not understand something, I said, 'It is my fault, I am
sinful'; but the more I fathomed the truth, the clearer
became the line between what I do not understand because
I am not able to understand it, and what cannot be understood
except by lying to oneself.</p>

<p>In spite of my doubts and sufferings, I still clung to the
Orthodox Church. But questions of life arose which had
to be decided; and the decision of these questions by the
Church, contrary to the very bases of the belief by which I
lived, obliged me at last to own that communion with
Orthodoxy is impossible. These questions were: first the
relation of the Orthodox Eastern Church to other Churches&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the Catholics and to the so-called sectarians. At that
time, in consequence of my interest in religion, I came into
touch with believers of various faiths: Catholics, Protestants,
Old-Believers, Molokáns and others. And I met
many men of lofty morals who were truly religious. I
wished to be a brother to them. And what happened?
That teaching which promised to unite all in one faith and
love&mdash;that very teaching, in the person of its best representatives,
told me that these men were all living a lie;
that what gave them their power of life, is a temptation of
the devil; and that we alone possess the only possible truth.
And I saw that all who do not profess an identical faith with
themselves, are considered by the Orthodox to be heretics;
just as the Catholics and others consider the Orthodox to
be heretics. And I saw that the Orthodox (though they
try to hide this) regard with hostility all who do not express
their faith by the same external symbols and words as themselves;
and this is naturally so: first, because the assertion
that you are in falsehood and I am in truth, is the most
cruel thing one man can say to another; and secondly,
because a man loving his children and brothers cannot help
being hostile to those who wish to pervert his children and
brothers to a false belief.... And to me, who considered
that truth lay in union by love, it became self-evident
that the faith was itself destroying what it ought to
produce.</p>

<p>As people of many different religions behave to one
another in this same contemptuous, self-assured manner&mdash;the
error of such conduct was obvious; and I thought
on the matter and read all I could about it, and consulted
all whom I could. And no one gave me any explanation
except the one which causes the Soúmsky Hussars to consider
the Soúmsky Hussars the best regiment in the world,
and the Yellow Uhlans to consider that the best regiment
in the world is the Yellow Uhlans.... I went to Archimandrites,
archbishops, elders, monks of the strictest Orders,
and asked them; but none of them made any attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
explain the matter to me, except one man, who explained
it all, and explained it so that I never asked any one any
more about it.</p>

<p>I asked him why we should not unite on those main
points on which we could agree, and leave the rest for each
to decide as he pleases. My collocutor agreed with my
thoughts, but told me that such concessions would bring
reproach on the spiritual authorities for deserting the faith
of our forefathers, and this would produce a split; and the
vocation of the spiritual authorities is to safeguard in all
its purity the Greco-Russian Orthodox faith inherited from
our forefathers.</p>

<p>And I understood it all. I am seeking a faith, the power
of life; and they are seeking the best way to fulfil before
men certain human obligations.... And I noticed what is
done in the name of religion, and was horrified; and I almost
entirely abjured Orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The second relation of the Church to a question of life,
was with regard to war and executions.</p>

<p>At that time Russia was at war. And Russians, in the
name of Christian love, began to kill their fellow-men.
It was impossible not to think about this, and not to see
that killing is an evil, repugnant to the first principles of
any faith. Yet they prayed in the churches for the success
of our arms, and the teachers of the faith acknowledged
killing to be an act resulting from the faith. And besides
the murders during the war, I saw during the disturbances
which followed the war, Church dignitaries and teachers and
monks of the lesser and stricter Orders, who approved the
killing of helpless erring youths. And I took note of all
that is done by men who profess Christianity, and I was
horrified.</p>

<p>And I ceased to doubt, and became fully convinced that
not all was true in the religion I had joined. Formerly I
should have said that it was all false; but I could not say
so now, for I had felt its truth and had lived by it. But I
no longer doubted that there is in it much that is false.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
And though among the peasants there was less admixture
of what repelled me, still I saw that in their belief also,
falsehood was mixed with the truth.</p>

<p>But where did the truth and where did the falsehood
come from? Both the falsehood and the truth were contained
in the so-called holy tradition and Scriptures. Both
the falsehood and the truth had been handed down by what
is called the Church.</p>

<p>And whether I liked to or not, I was brought to the
study and investigation of these writings and traditions&mdash;which
till now I had been so afraid to investigate.</p>

<p>And I turned to the examination of that same theology
which I had once rejected with such contempt.... On it
religious doctrine rests, or at least with it the only knowledge
of the meaning of life that I have found, is inseparably
connected.... I shall not seek the explanation of
everything. I know that the explanation of everything,
like the commencement of everything, must be concealed
in infinity. But I wish to understand in a way which
will bring me to what is inevitably inexplicable. I wish
to recognise anything that is inexplicable, as being so, not
because the demands of my reason are wrong (they are
right, and apart from them I can understand nothing), but
because I recognise the limits of my intellect. I wish to
understand in such a way that everything that is inexplicable
shall present itself to me as being necessarily inexplicable,
and not as being something I am under an arbitrary
obligation to believe. I must find what is true and what
is false, and must disentangle the one from the other. I
am setting to work upon this task. What of falsehood I
find in the teaching, and what I find of truth, and to what
conclusions I come, will form the following parts of this
work, which if it be worth it, and if any one wants it, will
probably some day be printed somewhere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These closing words in which Tolstoy expresses the hope
that his work 'will probably some day be printed some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>where,'
are a reminder of the difficulties and dangers that
had to be encountered in Russia by any man who set out to
challenge the authority of the Orthodox Church, whose
affairs were managed by the Holy Synod, presided over by a
Procurator able to call on the secular powers to enforce his
decisions.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Tolstoy's</span> writings during the first twenty-five years of his
literary career divide up into six sections.</p>

<p>First came a series of seventeen stories and sketches,
beginning with <i>Childhood</i> and ending with <i>Family Happiness</i>.
Next came his series of educational articles in the
<i>Yásnaya Polyána</i> magazine. Third came <i>The Cossacks</i>
(the finest story he had yet written) and <i>Polikoúshka</i>.
Fourth, came <i>War and Peace</i>. Fifth, came the <i>ABC</i> Book,
the <i>Readers</i>, and another article on Education; and sixth,
came <i>Anna Karénina</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving the educational works out of account, the list
can be reduced to nineteen stories and sketches, followed by
two great novels.</p>

<p>The nineteen sketches and stories, 'trials of the pen,' as
Tolstoy called them, covered a wide range of subjects, from
charmingly realistic sketches of childhood to vigorous depictions
of Cossack life, and showed their writer to be an
amazingly accurate observer of physical facts and qualities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
manners, tones and gestures, besides being possessed of a
yet more wonderful knowledge of the hearts and minds of
all sorts and conditions of men, from the shame-faced child
to the officer dying on the field of battle. He is so concerned
with the interest and importance of life, that he can
hold his reader's attention without having to tell his stories
so that they must be guessed like riddles, and he never
makes use of elaborate plots. He needs no tricks of that
sort. Nor does he strive after effect by the use of pornographic
details, the introduction of extraordinary events, or
the piling up of many horrible details. His stories are as
straightforward as everyday life.</p>

<p>His great novels bear out all the promise of his short
stories, with the added power of maturity.</p>

<p>Though highly original and of strong individuality, he
stands none the less in the line of succession of great writers
which began with Poúshkin, whose genius for simple sincere
and direct narrative gave an invaluable direction to Russian
literature, was continued by Gógol whose biting irony and
remorseless exposure of shams and hypocrisies completed
the emancipation from romanticism, and was carried on by
Tourgénef, whose art, conscious of and not indifferent to the
trend of thought and feeling in the society it describes,
reached an extraordinary pitch of artistic perfection.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's works have from the first interested Russia, and
now interest the world, because in greater measure than any
of his predecessors he possesses the capacity to feel intensely,
note accurately, and think deeply. The combination which
makes Tolstoy the most interesting of writers, is the scientific
accuracy of his observation (which never allows him to take
liberties with his characters or events in order to make out
a case for the side he sympathises with) and the fact that he
is mightily in earnest. Life to him is important, and art is
the handmaid of life. He wants to know what is good and
what is bad; to help the former and to resist the latter. His
work tends to evolve order out of life's chaos; and as that is
the most important thing a man can do, his books are among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
the most interesting and important books of our time. He
makes no pretence of standing aloof, cutting off his art from
his life, or concealing his desire that kindness should prevail
over cruelty. Life interests him, and therefore the reflection
of life interests him, and the problems of art are the
problems of life: love and passion and death and the desire
to do right.</p>

<p>The chief subject reappearing again and again throughout
the stories he wrote before <i>War and Peace</i>, is the mental
striving of a young Russian nobleman to free himself from
the artificial futilities of the society in which he was born,
and to see and do what is right. The search is only partially
successful. The indictment of society is often convincing,
but the heroes' failures and perplexities are frankly
admitted. Sometimes there is no hero. In <i>Sevastopol</i>, for
instance, he exclaims: 'Where in this tale is the evil shown
that should be avoided? Where is the good that should
be imitated? Who is the villain, who the hero of the story?
All are good and all are bad'; and in <i>Lucerne</i> he says:
'Who will define for me what is freedom, what despotism,
what civilisation and what barbarism? Or tell me where
are the limits of the one or the other? Who has in his
soul so immovable a <i>standard of good and evil</i> that by it he
can measure the passing facts of life?'</p>

<p>This searching for what is good and rejecting what is false&mdash;resulting
in a strong distrust and dislike of the predatory
masterful domineering types of humanity, and in general
of what has usually been regarded as the heroic type, and
also in a friendly compassion for all that is humble simple
forbearing and sincere&mdash;is the keynote of Tolstoy's early
tales. They are studies of life, so truthful that the characters
seem to have an independent life of their own. They
speak for themselves, and at times, like Balaam, bless what
they were apparently expected to curse. For instance,
when Prince Nehlúdof insists on bringing the wandering
musician into the Schweizerhof Hotel in <i>Lucerne</i>, we feel
how uncomfortable he thereby makes the poor singer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
though that is evidently not what Tolstoy originally set out
to make us feel.</p>

<p><i>War and Peace</i>, besides being maturer than the preceding
tales, was composed during the early years of Tolstoy's
married life, when he felt more content with himself and
with life in general, and when his attitude towards existing
things was more tolerant and sympathetic than it had been,
or than it became in later years.</p>

<p>He told me that in <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karénina</i>
his aim was simply to amuse his readers. I am bound to
accept his statement; but one has only to read either of
those books to see that through them Tolstoy's ardent
nature found vent, with all its likes and dislikes, strivings,
yearnings, hopes and fears.</p>

<p>I asked Tolstoy why in <i>What is Art?</i> he relegates these
great novels to the realm of 'bad art'; and his answer
showed, as I expected it would, that he does not really consider
them at all bad, but condemns them merely as being
too long, and written in a way chiefly adapted to please
the leisured well-to-do classes, who have time for reading
novels in several volumes, because other people do their
rough work for them. Of <i>War and Peace</i> he said, 'It is,
one would think, harmless enough, but one never knows
how things will affect people,' and he went on to mention,
with regret, that one of Professor Zahárin's daughters had
told him that from his novels she had acquired a love of
balls and parties; things of which, at the time of our conversation,
he heartily disapproved.</p>

<p>In form, <i>War and Peace</i> is unlike any English novel, but
it resembles Poúshkin's <i>The Captain's Daughter</i> (though the
latter is a much shorter story) in that both works are
chronicles of Russian families, round whom the stories
centre. In <i>War and Peace</i> there are two families, the
Rostófs and the Bolkónskys.</p>

<p>The mighty drama of the Napoleonic advance from 1805
to 1812 comes into the novel, in so far as it affects the
members of those two families. But Tolstoy is not content
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
merely to tell us of historic events. He introduces a whole
philosophy of history, which is sound at bottom though no
doubt he somewhat overstates his case, as is his habit.
The theory is that the 'great' men of history count for very
little. They are the figureheads of forces that are beyond
their control. They do most good and least harm when,
like Koutoúzof, they are aware of the true direction of the
great human forces and adapt themselves to them; but
then they are modest, and the world does not esteem them
great. The typical case of the impotent 'great' man is
Napoleon in 1812, at the time of his invasion of Russia.
He posed before the world as a man of destiny whose will
and intellect decided the fate of empires. Yet from first to
last, during that campaign, he never in the least knew what
was about to happen. The result was decided by the spirit
of the Russian nation, and by its steadfast endurance. Every
common Russian soldier who understood that the Russian
people dreaded and detested the thought of a foreign yoke,
and who therefore co-operated with the natural course of
events, did more to further the result than Napoleon, that
'most insignificant tool of history,' as Tolstoy calls him,
who even in St. Helena was never able to understand what
had caused his overthrow.</p>

<p>The main theme of the novel, if it be permissible to select
a main theme out of the many latent in the story, is Tolstoy's
favourite thesis. He tacitly asks: What is good and what
is bad? With what must we sympathise and what must we
reject? And the reply is that the predatory, artificial and
insincere types, exemplified historically by the invading
French, as well as by such characters among the Russians as
Ellen, Anatole and Dólohof, are repugnant to him, while
he loves the humble, the meek and the sincere: Marie and
Platon Karatáef, Natásha (so impulsive and charming in her
youth, so absorbed in her family later on), and Pierre (who is
often humble and always sincere, and loves ideas and ideals).</p>

<p>It is impossible to do justice to this wonderful book in
any brief summary. It is not a work to be summed up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
few pages. It has many characters, all of them so distinctly
drawn that we know them better than we know our
personal acquaintances. It treats of life's deepest experiences
from the cradle to the grave; and to read it with
the care it deserves is to know life better and see it more
sanely and seriously than one ever did before. Some
foolish people think that reading novels is a waste of time;
but there are hardly any books&mdash;at any rate hardly any
big books&mdash;that are better worth reading than Tolstoy's
novels.</p>

<p>He is probably justified in claiming that his history is
truer than the historians' history of the battles of Schöngraben,
Austerlitz, and Borodinó. The historians, from
mendacious military reports drawn up after the action, try
to discover what the Commanders-in-Chief meant to do;
and to tell their story within moderate limits they have to
systematise what was really a huge disorder; thereby giving
their readers a completely wrong impression of what a battle
is like.</p>

<p>N. N. Mouravyóf, a Commander-in-Chief who distinguished
himself in more than one war, declared he had never read
a better description of a battle than Tolstoy's account of
Schöngraben; and added that he was convinced from his
own experience that during a battle it is impossible to carry
out a Commander-in-Chief's orders.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, when he wrote the book, was convinced that war
is inevitable. The idea that it is man's duty to resist war
and to refuse to take part in it, came to him later.</p>

<p>In an article entitled 'Some Words about <i>War and
Peace</i>,' which he wrote in 1868 for one of the periodicals,
he says:</p>

<p>'Why did millions of people kill one another, when since
the foundation of the world it has been known that this is
both physically and morally bad?</p>

<p>'Because it was so inevitably necessary, that when doing
it they fulfilled the elemental zoological law bees fulfil when
they kill one another in autumn, and male animals fulfil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
when they destroy one another. No other reply can be
given to that dreadful question.'</p>

<p>Yet his inveterate truthfulness, and his personal knowledge
of war, caused him to describe it so exactly, that the
result is tantamount to a condemnation. As Kropótkin says,
<i>War and Peace</i> is a powerful indictment of war. The effect
which the great writer has exercised in this direction upon
his generation can be actually seen in Russia. It was
already apparent during the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-8,
when it was impossible to find in Russia a correspondent
who would have described how '<i>we</i> peppered the enemy with
grape-shot,' or how 'we knocked them down like ninepins.'
If any one could have been found to use in his letters such
survivals of barbarism, no paper would have dared to print
them. The general character of the Russian war-correspondent
had totally changed; and during that war there
appeared Gárshin the novelist, and Verestchágin the painter,
'with whom to combat war became a life work.'</p>

<p>It has been charged against <i>War and Peace</i> that it
neglects to show the evil side of serfdom: the brutality,
the cruelty, the immurement of women, the flogging of
grown-up sons, the torture of serf girls by their mistresses,
etc. But Tolstoy studied the period closely from letters,
diaries and traditions, especially from the records of his
own grandparents, the Tolstoys and the Volkónskys; and
he says he did not find horrors worse than are to be found
now, or at any other period. People then loved and envied,
and sought for truth and virtue, and were swayed by
passions, as now. Their mental and moral life was just as
complex, and in the upper circles it was sometimes even
more refined than now.... No doubt the greater remoteness
of the higher circle from the other classes gave a
special character to the period, but not the character of
brutal violence.</p>

<p>Tolstoy is in sympathy with that time, sees the poetry
of it, and knows how much of goodness, courage, kindliness
and high aspiration existed among those politically unenfranchised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
serf-owners. With our modern, Western desire
to <i>organise society efficiently</i>, he never has sympathised. The
state of a man's mind has always been to him more important
than the conditions of his life, and it seems to him
as though there were some antithesis between the two: as
though, if you organised your society, it would cease to think
truly or feel deeply. We in the West are beginning to
believe the opposite, and to suspect that to leave society
unorganised or disorganised has an inevitable tendency to
blunt our minds and souls. But not the less is it valuable
to have so wonderful a picture of Russia as it was at
the commencement of the nineteenth century, painted by
one who sees it as the best Russians of that period saw it
themselves.</p>

<p>Of the history part of the book, it should be noted that
Tolstoy says: 'Wherever in my novel historic characters
speak or act, I have not invented, but have made use of
materials which during my work have accumulated till they
form a whole library.'</p>

<p>He told me he considered the defect of the book, besides
its size, to be the intrusion of a long philosophic argument
into the story. He still holds the opinions he held when he
wrote it, as to the influence or impotence of 'great' men, as
well as all that he then said about destiny and free will;
but he now realises that his novel would have been a
better novel without these abstract disquisitions.</p>

<p>The characters in the book are not strictly copied from
life, but in the main Tolstoy's father's family are represented
by the Rostófs and his mother's by the Bolkónskys. In the
magazine article already referred to, Tolstoy says that only
two minor characters are taken from life, and 'all the other
characters are entirely invented, and I have not even for
them any definite prototypes in tradition or in reality.'
But when he said that, he was defending himself from
the charge of having copied actual people who had played
a part in the society of the time, and he clearly overstates
his case, for to a considerable extent the characters in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
novel correspond to the people mentioned in the following

<p>Tolstoy's sympathies and antipathies in this novel: his
appreciation of affection, kindliness, simplicity and truthfulness,
and his dislike of what is cruel, pompous, complicated
or false, are the same as in his earlier stories, but
mellowed and wiser; they are also the same as in his later
didactic writings, though there they are formulated, dogmatic
and rigid.</p>

<p>The novel covers nearly the whole range of Tolstoy's
experience of life: in it we have the aristocracy and the
peasants; town life and country life; the Commanders,
officers and privates of the army, in action and out of
action; the diplomatists and courtiers; flirtation, love,
balls, hunting, and a reform movement which is all talk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
What Tolstoy does not show, is what he did not know&mdash;the
middle-class world: the world of merchants, manufacturers,
engineers and men of business. Of course these in
Russia a hundred years ago, played a comparatively small
part; and there was practically no political activity such as
that of our County Councils, Borough Councils and Parliament.
But that all this was absent from Tolstoy's mind,
and that his outlook on life was confined to the aristocracy
which consumed and the peasantry which produced, will, in
the sequel, help us to understand the social teaching to which
he ultimately came. His brother-in-law tells us that Leo
Tolstoy 'has in my presence confessed to being both proud
and vain. He was a rampant aristocrat, and though he
always loved the country folk, he loved the aristocracy still
more. To the middle class he was antipathetic. When,
after his failures in early life, he became widely famous as a
writer, he used to admit that it gave him great pleasure and
intense happiness. In his own words, he was pleased to feel
that he was both a writer and a noble.'</p>

<p>'When he heard of any of his former comrades or acquaintances
receiving important appointments, his comments reminded
one of those of Souvórof [a Field-Marshal of
Catherine the Great's time], who always maintained that
at Court one receives promotion for cringing and flattery,
but never for good work. Sometimes he would ironically
remark that, though he had himself not earned a Generalship
in the artillery, he had at any rate won his Generalship
in literature.'</p>

<p>A simple world of nobles and peasants, with little organisation,
and that of a poor kind: a world the evils of which
were mitigated by much kindliness and good intention, and
in which, on the whole, the less the Government interfered
with anybody or anything, the better&mdash;was old Russia as it
existed under Alexander I and as it still existed when
Tolstoy was young. He has described it with extraordinary
vividness, and has made it possible for us to picture to ourselves
a country and an age not our own. What effect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
limitation of his outlook, referred to above, had on the
subsequent development of his opinions, need not here be
considered. It does not spoil the novel, for no novel can
show us the whole of life; but it had a very serious effect
on the formulation of his later philosophy of life. Of
certain important types of humanity he has hardly any
conception. Of the George Stephenson type, for instance,
which masters the brute forces of nature and harnesses them
to the service of man&mdash;doing this primarily from love of
efficient work&mdash;he knows nothing; nor does he know any
thing of the Sidney Webb type, which sets itself the yet
more difficult task of evolving social order out of the partial
chaos of modern civilisation; or of the best type of organisers
in our great industrial undertakings: the men whose hearts
are set on getting much work well done, with little friction
and little waste, and to whom the successful accomplishment
of a difficult project gives more satisfaction than any
effortless acquisition of wealth would do. Tolstoy over-simplifies
life's problems. He makes a sharp contrast between
the predatory and the humble types; and there is a
measure of truth in his presentation. He is right that life
is supported by the humble, and is rendered hard by the
predatory types; but he has omitted from his scheme of
things the man of organising mind: the man who knows
how to get his way, and generally gets it (or a good deal of
it) but does this mainly from worthy motives; the man who
is not perfect, and may take more than is good for him,
and may have some of the tendencies of the predatory type,
but who still, on the whole, is worth, and more than worth,
his salt, and but for whom there would be more of chaos
and less of order in the world. Tolstoy has said in one of
his later writings that the cause of the Russian famines is
the Greek Church; and he is right. All that stupefies, all
that impedes thought, tends to make men inefficient even in
their agricultural operations. But by parity of reasoning
he should see that the introduction of thought into methods
of production, distribution and exchange, which has, during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the last hundred and fifty years, so revolutionised our Western
world, should not be condemned as bad in itself, however
ugly many of its manifestations may be; and however often
we may see the organising and the predatory types exemplified
in one and the same person.</p>

<p>Outside Russia, <i>Anna Karénina</i> is perhaps more popular
than <i>War and Peace</i>. The former is a long novel, but not
nearly as long as the latter; and though it contains philosophic
disquisitions, these fit better into the story and are
shorter and clearer than the philosophic chapters in <i>War
and Peace</i>. In arrangement, again, <i>Anna Karénina</i> is more
like the novels we are accustomed to, though instead of one
hero and heroine it has two pairs of lovers, living quite
different lives, and not very closely connected.</p>

<p>It deals with the passionate love of a beautiful and
attractive woman; and it has a further interest in the fact
that Lévin, to a greater degree than any of the author's other
characters, represents Tolstoy himself; though Tolstoy
made Lévin a very simple fellow in order to get a more
effective contrast between him and the representatives of
high life in Moscow and Petersburg.</p>

<p><i>Anna Karénina</i> had the advantage of being introduced to
the English reading public by Matthew Arnold in an essay
which is one of the very best any one has ever written
about Tolstoy. It is so good, and still carries so much
weight, that I may be excused for mentioning three points
on which it seems to me misleading. First, Arnold's ground
for preferring <i>Anna Karénina</i> to <i>War and Peace</i> is ill chosen.
He says: 'One prefers, I think, to have the novelist dealing
with the life which he knows from having lived it, rather
than with the life which he knows from books or hearsay.
If one has to choose a representative work of Thackeray, it
is <i>Vanity Fair</i> which one would take rather than <i>The
Virginians</i>.'</p>

<p>This surely is misleading. War in Russia in 1812 was
very similar to war in Russia in 1854, and the son who had
fought in the latter war, describing the war in which his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
father had fought, was not at all in the position of
Thackeray describing the life of the Virginians. Tolstoy
depicting the homes of his parents and grandparents, which
he in part remembered, and which he at any rate knew well
from those who had formed part of them, was as close to
first-hand experience as he was when describing the life of
Karénin the pedantic Petersburg statesman, who belonged
to a world which was essentially foreign to Tolstoy, though
he had occasionally glanced at it.</p>

<p>But the sentence in Arnold's essay which has done most
harm, is that in which he speaks about translations: 'I use
the French translation; in general, as I long ago said, work
of this kind is better done in France than in England, and
<i>Anna Karénina</i> is perhaps also a novel which goes better
into French than into English.'</p>

<p>It is true enough that the first English translations of
Tolstoy were very poor, and it is also true that the French
versions, so long as Tourgénef attended to them, were
really good. But Arnold was wrong in supposing that
<i>Anna Karénina</i> would naturally go better into French
than into English. Had he been able to read the original,
or had he been acquainted with Russian life, he would
have seen that in Tolstoy's novels there are two sets of
people: a Court, Petersburg set, who continually speak
French and are Frenchified; and a plain, homely, straightforward
Russian (I had almost said, English) set who do
not use French phrases, and who are sharply contrasted
with the others. This contrast can be made quite clear
in an English version, but it is difficult to make it clear in
a version where even the most Russian characters have to
speak French. The case is worse than that, however:
Arnold did not say, as he fairly might have said, that up
to his time the French versions were better than the
English; he speaks as though it were in the nature of
things that any translation into French must be better
than any possible translation into English. A prejudice of
that kind tends to divert attention from the fact that some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
French translations are bad, and some English translations
are good. As a matter of fact, since Arnold's time the position
has been largely reversed. When staying at Yásnaya
Polyána in 1902, I heard Tolstoy express considerable dissatisfaction
with the new collected French edition of his
works, the first volumes of which had then recently appeared,
while he commended some recent English versions, including
work done by Mrs. Garnett and by my wife.</p>

<p>A grave error, again, is made by Arnold in speaking of
Tolstoy's later life, where he says that he 'earns his bread
by the labour of his own hands.' Tolstoy never did that, and
never claimed to have done it; though it is extraordinary
how often and how confidently the statement has been
repeated. It is a matter however which need not detain us,
for it does not relate to the period with which this volume
deals.</p>

<p>Arnold's summary of the story of the novel is excellent,
but I can here only quote one more passage from his essay.
'We have,' he says, 'been in a world which misconducts
itself nearly as much as the world of a French novel all
palpitating with "modernity." But there are two things
in which the Russian novel&mdash;Count Tolstoi's novel at any
rate&mdash;is very advantageously distinguished from the type
of novel now so much in request in France. In the first
place, there is no fine sentiment, at once tiresome and false.
We are not told to believe, for example, that Anna is
wonderfully exalted and ennobled by her passion for Vrónsky.
The English reader is thus saved from many a groan of
impatience. The other thing is yet more important. Our
Russian novelist deals abundantly with criminal passion and
with adultery, but he does not seem to feel himself owing
any service to the goddess Lubricity, or bound to put in
touches at this goddess's dictation. Much in <i>Anna Karénina</i>
is painful, much is unpleasant, but nothing is of a nature to
trouble the senses, or to please those who wish their senses
troubled. This taint is wholly absent.'</p>

<p>W. D. Howells, who has stood sponsor for Tolstoy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
America as Matthew Arnold has done in England, similarly
says: 'It is Tolstoy's humanity which is the grace beyond
the reach of art in his imaginative work. It does not reach
merely the poor and the suffering; it extends to the
prosperous and the proud, and does not deny itself to the
guilty. There had been many stories of adultery before
<i>Anna Karénina</i>, nearly all the great novels outside of
English are framed upon that argument, but in <i>Anna
Karénina</i>, for the first time the whole truth was told about
it. Tolstoy has said of the fiction of Maupassant that the
whole truth can never be immoral; and in his own work I
have felt that it could never be anything but moral.'</p>

<p>Tolstoy never fears to deal with the real problems of life,
and never fears to call a spade a spade; but he also never
panders to the animal passions. In a letter relating to
<i>Resurrection</i> he remarked: 'When I read a book, what
chiefly interests me is the <i>Weltanschauung des Autors</i>: what
he likes and what he hates. And I hope that any one who
reads my book with that in view will find out what the
author likes and dislikes, and will be influenced by the
author's feelings.' What is important is not the subject
treated of, but the feeling the author imparts when dealing
with it.</p>

<p>Arnold, it is true, is rather shocked that Anna should
yield so quickly and easily to the persuasions of Vrónsky.
He is quite sure that she ought to have resisted. But here
we come to a matter on which many Russians disapprove of
Tolstoy on quite the opposite ground. Kropótkin in his
interesting work <i>Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature</i>,
has stated their case very clearly, and this is the substance
of what he says:</p>

<p><i>Anna Karénina</i> produced in Russia an impression which
brought Tolstoy congratulations from the reactionary camp
and a very cool reception from the advanced portion of
society. The fact is that the question of marriage and of
the separation of husband and wife, had been most earnestly
debated in Russia by the best men and women, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
literature and in life. Levity towards marriage such as is
continually unveiled in the Divorce Courts, was decidedly
condemned, as also was any form of deceit such as supplies
the subject for countless French novels and plays. But
after levity and deceit had been condemned, the right of a
new love&mdash;appearing perhaps after years of happy married
life&mdash;was seriously considered, Tchernyshévsky's novel,
<i>What Is To Be Done?</i> may be taken as the best expression
of the opinions on marriage which became current among
the better portion of the young generation. Once married,
it was said, don't take lightly to love affairs or flirtation.
Not every fit of passion deserves the name of a new love;
and what is called love is often merely temporary desire.
Even if it be real, before it has grown deep there is
generally time to reflect on the consequences that would
result were it allowed to grow. But when all is said and
done, there are cases when a new love does come, and comes
almost inevitably: as for instance when a girl has been
married almost against her will under the continued insistence
of her lover, or when the two have married without
properly understanding one another, or when one of the
two has continued to progress towards an ideal, while the
other, after having worn the mask of idealism, falls back
into the Philistine happiness of warmed slippers. In such
cases separation not only becomes inevitable, but is often to
the interest of both. It would be better for both to live
through the suffering a separation involves (honest natures
are improved by such suffering) than to spoil the entire
subsequent life of one&mdash;or both in most cases&mdash;and to face
the evil consequences which living together under such
circumstances would be sure to produce on the children.
That at any rate was the conclusion to which, both in
literature and in life, the best portion of Russian society
came.</p>

<p>And into the society Kropótkin describes in the above
statement, comes Tolstoy with <i>Anna Karénina</i>. The
epigraph of the book is 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and death by suicide is the fate of poor Anna, who was
married young to an old and unattractive man, and who
had never known love till she met Vrónsky. Deceit was
not in her nature. To maintain a conventional marriage
would not have made her husband or child happier.
Separation and a new life with Vrónsky, who seriously loved
her, was the only possible outcome. At any rate, continues
Kropótkin, if the story of <i>Anna Karénina</i> had to end in
tragedy, it was not in consequence of an act of supreme
justice. The artistic genius of Tolstoy, honest here as
everywhere, itself indicated the real cause, in the inconsistency
of Vrónsky and Anna. After leaving her husband
and defying public opinion&mdash;that is, as Tolstoy shows, the
opinion of women not honest enough to have a right to a
voice in the matter&mdash;neither she nor Vrónsky had the
courage to break right away from that society, the futility
of which Tolstoy describes so exquisitely. Instead of that,
when Anna returns with Vrónsky to Petersburg, their chief
preoccupation is, how Betsy and other such women will
receive her if she reappears among them? 'And it was the
opinion of the Betsies&mdash;surely not Superhuman Justice&mdash;which
brought Anna to suicide.'</p>

<p>Whether Matthew Arnold's view or Kropótkin's view be
accepted, Tolstoy at any rate does full justice to Anna's
charm: 'her large, fresh, rich, generous, delightful nature
which keeps our sympathy' and even our respect; there is
no nonsense about her being a degraded or vile person.
And after all, Tolstoy's view of marriage sanctity is a very
old and a very widely held one; and it is surely good to
have that side of the case put so artistically, so persuasively,
so well, as he puts it. If ultimately the idea that two
uncongenial people ought to live out their lives together
because they have married, has to be abandoned, let it not
be abandoned without the very best advocates being heard
on its behalf.</p>

<p><i>Anna Karénina</i> contains passages: the ball, the officers'
steeplechase, the mowing, the death of Lévin's brother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
others, which for artistic beauty are unsurpassed and, one is
tempted to add, unsurpassable. It also, towards the end,
contains in admirably concise form much of what Tolstoy
has told in his <i>Confession</i>, of his quest after the meaning of
life, his thoughts of suicide, and how he learnt from a
talk with a peasant that man should live for his soul and
for God.</p>

<p>His treatment in this novel of the Russian volunteers who
went to fight for Servia, was as bold a slap in the face to
the Russian jingoes, who were having things all their own
way at that time, as Campbell Bannerman's 'methods of
barbarism' speech, or Sir E. Clarke's declaration that the
reassertion of England's claim to suzerainty in the internal
affairs of the Transvaal, was 'a breach of national faith,'
was to our jingoes at the time of the Boer war; but it is
curious to note the precise position that (speaking through
the mouth of Lévin) Tolstoy took up. He did not say
that Russia ought not to fight to free the Christian
populations of Turkey; he merely said that no individual
Russian had any business to volunteer for the Servian or
Bulgarian army, or to take any action to urge the Russian
Government towards war.</p>

<p>Of Lévin we are told: 'He, like Miháylitch and the
peasants, whose feelings are expressed in the legendary story
of the invitation sent to the Varyági by the early inhabitants
of Russia, said: "Come and be princes and rule over
us. <i>We gladly promise complete submission.</i> All labour,
all humiliations, all sacrifices we take on ourselves, but <i>we
do not judge or decide</i>."' And Lévin goes on to repudiate
the idea that the Russian people have 'now renounced this
privilege [the privilege, that is, of not taking any part in
Government] bought at so costly a price.'</p>

<p>The connection between the roots of Tolstoy's opinions&mdash;manifested
in these writings of his first fifty years&mdash;and
his opinions in their ultimate rigid and dogmatic form, as
expressed during the last three decades, is in general so
close, the dogmas of the later period grew so naturally out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
of the sympathies and experiences of the earlier time, that
this point&mdash;at which there is a clean line of cleavage (the
difference between obeying Government and disobeying it)&mdash;is
worthy of particular note. When finishing <i>Anna
Karénina</i> Tolstoy had not yet reached the conclusion that
all Governments employing force are immoral; but his later
teachings are dominated by that view.</p>

<p>Apart from the special points I have referred to, the
general effect and influence of Tolstoy's fiction can hardly
be summed up better than they have been summed up by
W. D. Howells, who says:</p>

<p>'Up to his time fiction had been a part of the pride of
life, and had been governed by the criterions of the world
which it amused. But Tolstoy replaced the artistic conscience
by the human conscience. Great as my wonder was
at the truth in his work, my wonder at the love in it was
greater yet. Here, for the first time, I found the most
faithful picture of life set in the light of that human conscience
which I had falsely taught myself was to be ignored
in questions of art, as something inadequate and inappropriate.
In the august presence of the masterpieces, I had
been afraid and ashamed of the highest interests of my
nature as something philistine and provincial. But here
I stood in the presence of a master, who told me not to be
ashamed of them, but to judge his work by them, since he
had himself wrought in honour of them. I found the tests
of conduct which I had used in secret with myself, applied
as the rules of universal justice, condemning and acquitting
in motive and action, and admitting none of those lawyer's
pleas which baffle our own consciousness of right and wrong.
Often in Tolstoy's ethics I feel a hardness, almost an arrogance
(the word says too much); but in his esthetics I have
never felt this. He has transmuted the atmosphere of
a realm hitherto supposed unmoral into the very air of
heaven. I found nowhere in his work those base and cruel
lies which cheat us into the belief that wrong may sometimes
be right through passion, or genius, or heroism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
There was everywhere the grave noble face of the truth
that had looked me in the eyes all my life, and that I knew
I must confront when I came to die. But there was something
more than this, infinitely more. There was that love
which is before even the truth, without which there is no
truth, and which if there is any last day, must appear the
Divine justice....</p>

<p>'As I have already more than once said, his ethics and
esthetics are inseparably at one; and that is what gives a
vital warmth to all his art. It is never that heartless skill
which exists for its own sake, and is content to dazzle with
the brilliancy of its triumphs. It seeks always the truth, in
the love to which alone the truth unveils itself. If Tolstoy
is the greatest imaginative writer who ever
lived, it is because, beyond all others, he has
written in the spirit of kindness, and not denied
his own personal complicity with his art.</p>

<p>'As for the scope of his work, it would not be easy to
measure it, for it seems to include all motives and actions,
in good and bad, in high and low, and not to leave life untouched
at any point as it shows itself in his vast Russian
world. Its chief themes are the old themes of art always,&mdash;they
are love, passion, death, but they are treated with such
a sincerity, such a simplicity, that they seem almost new to
art, and as effectively his as if they had not been touched
before....</p>

<p>'Passion, we have to learn from the great master, who here
as everywhere humbles himself to the truth, has in it life
and death; but of itself it is something, only as a condition
precedent to these; without it neither can be; but it is lost
in their importance, and is strictly subordinate to their laws.
It has never been more charmingly and reverently studied
in its beautiful and noble phases than it is in Tolstoy's
fiction; though he has always dealt with it so sincerely, so
seriously. As to its obscure and ugly and selfish phases, he
is so far above all others who have written of it, that he
alone seems truly to have divined it, or portrayed it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
experience knows it. He never tries to lift it out of nature
in either case, but leaves it more visibly and palpably a part
of the lowest as well as the highest humanity....</p>

<p>'He comes nearer unriddling life for us than any other
writer. He persuades us that it cannot possibly give us any
personal happiness; that there is no room for the selfish joy
of any one except as it displaces the joy of some other, but
that for unselfish joy there is infinite place and occasion.
With the same key he unlocks the mystery of death; and
he imagines so strenuously that death is neither more nor
less than a transport of self-surrender that he convinces the
reason where there can be no proof. The reader will not
have forgotten how in those last moments of earth which he
has depicted, it is this utter giving up which is made to
appear the first moment of heaven. Nothing in his mastery
is so wonderful as his power upon us in the scenes of the
borderland where his vision seems to pierce the confines of
another world.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tolstoy of the later phase, the last three decades, with
which the second volume of this work will deal, differed
from the Tolstoy of the first fifty years; but the later
Tolstoy grew out of the earlier, as the branches of a tree
grow from its roots.</p>

<p>The difference lay chiefly in this: that from about the
year 1878 Tolstoy became sure of himself, succeeded in formulating
his outlook on life, and proceeded to examine and
pass judgment on all the main phases of human thought and
activity. His work was sometimes hasty and often harsh; he
painted in black and white, subjects really composed of many
shades of colours; but what other man has even attempted
so to examine, to portray, and to tell the frank truth about
all the greatest problems of life and death?</p>

<p>No one really concerned to leave the world better than he
found it&mdash;be his line of work what it may&mdash;can afford to
ignore what Tolstoy has said on his subject.</p>

<p>No such combination of intellectual and artistic force has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
in our times provoked the attention of mankind. No one
has so stimulated thought, or so successfully challenged
established opinions. Tolstoy has altered the outlook on
life of many men in many lands, and has caused some
to alter not their ideas merely, but the settled habits and
customs of their lives. Only those who neither know
nor understand him at all, ever question his sincerity.</p>

<p>Those who have spoken scornfully of him are those who
have not taken the trouble to understand him. On the
other hand, the small minority who swallow his opinions
whole, do so under the hypnotic influence of his force,
fervour and genius. To analyse his opinions, and disentangle
what in them is true from what is false, is
a task no one has yet adequately performed, but for
which the time is ripe, and which, bold as the undertaking
may be, I mean to attempt.</p>

<p>Tolstoy's marvellous artistic power, his sincerity, and the
love that is so strong a feature of his work, have often been
dwelt upon; but what really gives him his supreme importance
as a literary force is the <i>union</i> of all these things:
artistic capacity, sincerity and love, with a quite extraordinary
power of intellect.</p>

<p>It is not given to any man to solve all the problems of
life; but no one has made so bold and interesting an
attempt to do so as Tolstoy, or has striven so hard to
make his solutions plain to every child of man.</p>


<h3>CHIEF AUTHORITIES FOR CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p>The literature that has grown up both in Russia and elsewhere
round Tolstoy's earlier writings is so voluminous, that I can merely
indicate a few of the best known works.</p>

<p>In English we have:</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold's essay: <i>Count Leo Tolstoi</i> in <i>Essays in Criticism,
Second Series</i>: Macmillan and Co., London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
W. D. Howells has written several very readable and excellent essays
on Tolstoy. I have unfortunately mislaid my note of them. If any
American admirer of W. D. Howells will supply me with a list, I shall
be glad to include it in any future edition of this work.</p>

<p>P. Kropotkin's <i>Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature</i> gives a very
good idea of Tolstoy's general influence and relation to Russian life
and literature generally.</p>

<p>In Russian:</p>

<p>Mihaylovsky's articles in his collected works are interesting.</p>

<p>N. Strahof's <i>Krititcheskiya Statyi o Tourgeneve i Tolstom</i>, Petersburg,
1895, is excellent.</p>

<p>V. Zelinsky's <i>Rousskaya Krititcheskaya Literatoura o proizvedeniyakh
L. N. Tolstovo</i> (7 vols.) reprints a large collection of Russian criticisms
on Tolstoy's works.</p>

<p>D. S. Merezhkovsky's <i>Zhizn i tvortchestvo L. N. Tolstovo i Dostoyevskavo</i>
contains some acute literary criticism, but for all that relates
to Tolstoy as a man, it is worse than useless. Merezhkovsky did not
know Tolstoy personally when he wrote about him. He relied on the
works of Behrs and Anna Seuron, and even that scrappy information
he used unfairly. His talk about scents and fine linen, and in general
his whole characterisation of Tolstoy, is spiteful, and to those who
know the man attacked, it is merely ridiculous.</p>

behind our calendar), unless the contrary is expressly stated.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Russian babies are usually swaddled tightly with bands, making them
look like fresh mummies.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> All that you say about the perversity of play is very true, and
I often think about it, and that is why I believe that I shall gamble no
more.... 'I believe,' but I hope soon to tell you for certain.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> I went to the fête at Sokólniki in detestable weather, which was
why I did not meet any of the society ladies I wished to see. As you
say I am a man who tests himself, I went among the plebs in the
gipsy tents. You can easily imagine the inward struggle I there
experienced, for and against. However, I came out victorious:
that is to say, having given nothing but my blessing to the gay
descendants of the illustrious Pharaohs. Nicholas considers me a
very agreeable travelling companion, except for my cleanliness. He
is cross because he says I change my linen 12 times a day. I also
find him a very agreeable companion, except for his dirtiness. I do
not know which of us is right.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Nicholas left within a week of his arrival and I have followed him,
so that we have now been almost three weeks here, lodging in a tent
But as the weather is fine and I am getting accustomed to this kind
of life, I feel very well. There are magnificent views here, beginning
where the springs are situated. It is an enormous mountain of rocks
one upon another, some of which are detached and form, as it were,
grottoes; others remain suspended at a great height. They are all
intersected by torrents of hot water which fall noisily in certain parts
and, especially in the morning, cover the whole upper part of the
mountain with a white vapour which this boiling water continually
gives off. The water is so hot that one can boil eggs hard in three
minutes. In the middle of this ravine, by the chief torrent, stand
three mills one above the other, built in a quite peculiar and very
picturesque manner. All day long, above and below these mills,
Tartar women come unceasingly to wash clothes. I should mention
that they wash with their feet. It is like an ant-hill, always in
motion. The women, for the most part, are beautiful and well formed.
In spite of their poverty the costumes of Oriental women are graceful.
The picturesque groups formed by the women, added to the
savage beauty of the place, furnish a really admirable <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>.
I very often remain for hours admiring the view. Then again, in
quite a different way, the view from the top of the mountain is even
more beautiful. But I fear to weary you with my descriptions.</p>

<p>I am very glad to be at the springs, for I benefit by them. I take
ferruginous baths, and no longer have pain in my feet.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Do you remember, dear Aunt, the advice you once gave me&mdash;to
write novels? Well, I am following your advice, and the occupation
I mentioned to you consists in producing literature. I do not know
if what I am writing will ever be published, but it is work that
amuses me, and in which I have persevered too long to abandon it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I have just received your letter of 24 November, and I reply
at once (as I have formed the habit of doing). I wrote you lately
that your letter made me cry, and I blamed my illness for that weakness.
I was wrong. For some time past all your letters have had
the same effect on me. I always was Leo Cry-baby. Formerly I was
ashamed of this weakness, but the tears I shed when thinking of you,
and of your love for us, are so sweet that I let them flow without any
false shame. Your letter is too full of sadness not to produce the
same effect on me. It is you who have always given me counsel,
and though unfortunately I have not always followed it, I should
wish all my life to act only in accord with your advice. For the
moment, permit me to tell you the effect your letter has had on me,
and the thoughts that have come to me while reading it. If I speak
too freely, I know you will forgive it, on account of the love I have
for you. By saying that it is your turn to leave us, to rejoin those
who are no more and whom you have loved so much, by saying that
you ask God to set a limit to your life which seems to you so insupportable
and isolated&mdash;pardon me, dear Aunt, but it seems to me that
in so saying you offend God and me and all of us who love you so
much. You ask God for death, that is to say, for the greatest misfortune
that can happen to me. (This is not a phrase, for God is
my witness that the two greatest misfortunes that could come to me
would be your death and that of Nicholas&mdash;the two persons whom I
love more than myself.) What would be left to me if God granted
your prayer? To please whom should I then wish to become better,
to have good qualities and a good reputation in the world? When
I make plans of happiness for myself, the idea that you will share
and enjoy my happiness is always present. When I do anything
good, I am satisfied with myself because I know you will be satisfied
with me. When I act badly, what I most fear is to cause you
grief. Your love is everything to me, and you ask God to separate
us! I cannot tell you what I feel for you; words do not suffice to
express it. I fear lest you should think I exaggerate, and yet I shed
hot tears while writing to you.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> To-day one of those things happened to me which would have
made me believe in God, if I had not for some time past firmly
believed in Him.</p>

<p>In summer, at Stáry Urt, all the officers who were there did nothing
but play, and play rather high. As, living in camp, one has to
meet frequently, I was very often present at play, but in spite of
persuasions I kept steady for a month; but one fine day for fun I
put down a small stake. I lost, staked again, and lost again. I was
in bad luck; the passion for play reawoke in me, and in two days I
had lost all the money I had, and what Nicholas gave me (about
Rs. 250) and another Rs. 500 besides, for which I gave a note-of-hand
payable in January 1852.</p>

<p>I should tell you that near the camp there is an Aoul [native
village] inhabited by Circassians. A young fellow (a Circassian)
named Sádo used to come to the camp and play; but as he could
neither reckon nor write, there were scamps who cheated him. For
that reason I never wished to play against Sádo, and I even told him
that he ought not to play, because he was being cheated; and I
offered to play for him. He was very grateful to me for this, and
presented me with a purse; and as it is the custom of that nation to
exchange presents, I gave him a wretched gun I had bought for
Rs. 8. I should tell you that to become a <i>Kounák</i>, that is to say, a
<i>friend</i>, it is customary to exchange presents, and afterwards to eat in
the house of one's <i>Kounák</i>. After that, according to the ancient
custom of these peoples (which hardly exists now except as a tradition)
you become friends for life and death: that is to say, if I asked
of him all his money, or his wife, or his weapons, or all the most
precious things he has, he must give them to me, and I also must
not refuse him anything. Sádo made me promise to come to his
house and become his Kounák. I went. After having regaled me
in their fashion, he asked me to choose anything in his house that I
liked: his weapons, his horse&mdash;anything. I wished to choose what
was of least value, and took a horse's bridle with silver mountings;
but he said I was offending him, and obliged me to take a sword worth
at least Rs. 100.</p>

<p>His father is a rather rich man, but keeps his money buried, and
does not give his son a cent. The son, to have money, goes and
steals horses and cows from the enemy. Sometimes he risks his life
20 times to steal something not worth Rs. 10, but he does it not
from greed, but because it is 'the thing.' The greatest robber is
most esteemed, and is called <i>Dzhigit</i>, 'a <i>Brave</i>.' Sometimes Sádo
has Rs. 1000, sometimes not a cent. After one visit to him, I gave
him Nicholas's silver watch, and we became the greatest friends in
the world. He has proved his devotion several times by exposing
himself to danger for my sake; but that is nothing to him&mdash;it has
become a habit and a pleasure.</p>

<p>When I left Stáry Urt and Nicholas remained there, Sádo used to
go to him every day, saying that he did not know how to get on
without me, and that he felt terribly dull. I wrote to Nicholas
saying that as my horse was ill I begged him to find me one at Stáry
Urt. Sádo having learnt this, must needs come to me and give me
his horse, in spite of all I could do to refuse it.</p>

<p>After the folly I committed in playing at Stáry Urt, I did not touch
a card again, and I was always lecturing Sádo, who is devoted to
gambling and, though he does not know how to play, always has
astonishing luck. Yesterday evening I was engaged in considering
my money matters and my debts, and thinking how I was to pay
them. Having long thought of these things, I saw that if I do not
spend too much, all my debts will not embarrass me, but can be paid
off little by little in 2 or 3 years; but the Rs. 500 that I had to pay
this month, threw me into despair. It was impossible for me to
pay it, and at the moment it embarrassed me much more than did
previously the 4000 of Ogaryóf. The stupidity, after having contracted
those debts in Russia, of coming here and adding fresh ones, made
me despair. In the evening while saying my prayers, I asked God&mdash;and
very fervently&mdash;to get me out of this disagreeable scrape. 'But
how can I get out of this scrape?' thought I, as I lay down. 'Nothing
can happen that will make it possible for me to meet that debt.'
I already pictured to myself all the unpleasantnesses I should have to
go through because of it. (See English sentence in the French text,
above.)</p>

<p>Next day I received a letter from Nicholas enclosing yours and
several others. He wrote me: (See English sentence in the French
text, above).</p>

<p>Is it not astonishing to see one's petitions granted like this the very
next day? That is to say, there is nothing so wonderful as the divine
goodness to one who merits it so little as I. And is not the trait of
Sádo's devotion admirable? He knows I have a brother Sergius, who
loves horses, and as I have promised to take him to Russia when
I go, he tells me that, if it costs him his life 100 times over, he
will steal the best horse to be found in the mountains, and will take
it to him.</p>

<p>Please, have a 6-barrelled pistol bought in Toúla and sent to me,
and also a musical-box, if that does not cost too much. These are
things which will give him much pleasure.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Religion and the experience I have of life (however small it may
be) have taught me that life is a trial. In my case it is more than a
trial, it is also an expiation of my faults.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the frivolous idea I had of journeying to the
Caucasus was an idea with which I was inspired from above. It is
the hand of God that has guided me&mdash;I do not cease to thank Him
for it. I feel that I have become better here (and that is not saying
much, for I was very bad) and I am firmly persuaded that all that can
happen to me here can only be for my good, since it is God himself
who has so willed it. Perhaps it is a very audacious notion;
nevertheless it is my conviction. That is why I bear the fatigues and the
physical privations I have mentioned (they are not physical privations:
there are none for a fellow of 23 who is in good health) without
resenting them, and even with a kind of pleasure in thinking of the
happiness that awaits me.</p>

<p>This is how I picture it:</p>

<p>After an indefinite number of years, neither young nor old, I am at
Yásnaya; my affairs are in order, I have no anxieties or worries.
You also live at Yásnaya. You have aged a little, but you are still
fresh and in good health. We lead the life we used to lead. I work
in the morning, but we see one another almost all day. We have
dinner. In the evening I read aloud something which does not weary
you, and then we talk. I tell you of my life in the Caucasus, you
tell me your recollections of my father and my mother; and you
tell me the 'terrible tales' we used to listen to with frightened eyes
and open mouths. We remind each other of those who were dear to
us and who are now no more; you will weep, I shall do the same,
but those tears will be sweet; we shall talk about my brothers,
who will come to see us from time to time; of dear Marie, who
with all her children will also spend some months of the year at
Yásnaya, which she loves so much. We shall have no acquaintances&mdash;no
one will come to weary us and carry tales. It is a
beautiful dream, but it is not all that I let myself dream.&mdash;I am
married. My wife is a gentle creature, kind and affectionate; she
has the same love for you as I have. We have children who call you
Grandmamma; you live upstairs in the big house, in what used to be
Grandmamma's room. The whole house is as it was in Papa's time,
and we recommence the same life, only changing our rôles. You take
the rôle of Grandmamma, but you are still better; I take Papa's
place, though I despair of ever deserving it; my wife, that of
Mamma; the children take ours; Marie, that of the two aunts (excepting
their misfortunes) ... but some one will be lacking to take
the part you played in our family&mdash;never will any one be found with
a soul so beautiful, so loving, as yours. You have no successor.
There will be three new characters who will appear from time to time
on the scene&mdash;the brothers, especially the one who will often be
with us, Nicholas: an old bachelor, bald, retired from service, as
good and noble as ever.</p>

<p>I imagine how he will, as of old, tell the children fairy tales
of his own invention, and how they will kiss his greasy hands
(but which are worthy of it), how he will play with them, how
my wife will bustle about to get him his favourite dishes, how
he and I will recall our common memories of days long past,
how you will sit in your accustomed place and listen to us with
pleasure; how, as of yore, you will call us, old men, 'Lyóvotchka'
and 'Nikólenka,' and will scold me for eating with
my fingers, and him for not having clean hands.</p>

<p>If they made me Emperor of Russia, or gave me Peru: in a word,
if a fairy came with her wand asking me what I wished for&mdash;my hand
on my conscience, I should reply that I only wish that this dream
may become a reality.</p>

to receive a St. George's Cross, and I was prevented from
receiving it by that confounded paper being a few days late. I was
nominated to receive it on 18 February (my name's day), but it had
to be refused me for want of that paper. The list of nominations was
sent off on the 19th, the paper came on the 20th. I frankly confess
that of all military honours, that little cross is the only one which
I have had the vanity to desire.</p>

and the point of view of those I meet here, for me to find any
pleasure in their company. Only Nicholas, in spite of the enormous

amuse himself with them, and to be loved by all. I envy him this
talent, but feel that I cannot do the same.</p>

for, it is for a good heart, sensitive and capable of love, which
it has pleased it to give me and to preserve in me.</p>

expected&mdash;quite as a relation. He embraced me, and made me promise
to dine at his house every day. He wants to keep me near him, but
this is not yet decided.</p>

<p>Forgive me, dear Aunt, for writing but little to you&mdash;I have not
yet collected my wits; this large and fine town, all these presentations,
the Italian opera, the French theatre, the two young Gortchakófs,
who are very fine lads ... so that I have not remained two
hours at home, and have not thought of my duties.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> While you are fancying me exposed to all the dangers of war, I
have not yet smelt Turkish powder, but am very quietly at Bucharest,
strolling about, making music, and eating ices. In fact, all this time,
except for two weeks I spent at Oltenitza, where I was attached to a
battery, and one week I passed making excursions in Moldavia
Wallachia and Bessarabia by order of General Serzhpoutóvsky, on
whose staff I now am by special appointment, I have been at Bucharest;
and to speak frankly, the rather dissipated, quite idle and very
expensive kind of life that I lead here, displeases me very much.
Formerly it was the service that kept me here; but now for three
weeks I have been kept here by a fever caught during my journey,
but from which, thank God, I have for the present recovered sufficiently
to be able in two or three days' time to rejoin my General, who
is in camp near Silistria. Apropos of my General, he appears to be
a very fine fellow, and though we know each other very slightly,
seems well disposed toward me. What is also agreeable is that his
staff consists for the most part of gentlemen.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> I am going to tell you of my recollections of Silistria. I there
saw so much that was interesting, poetic and touching, that the time
I passed there will never be effaced from my memory. Our camp was
on the other side of the Danube, <i>i.e.</i> on the right bank, on very high
ground amid splendid gardens belonging to Mustafa Pasha, the
Governor of Silistria. The view from that place is not only magnificent,
but of the greatest interest to us all. Not to speak of the
Danube, its islets and its banks, some occupied by us, others by the
Turks, one could see the town, the fortress and the little forts of
Silistria as on the palm of one's hand. One heard the booming of
cannon and musket-shots unceasingly day and night; and with a spy-glass
one could distinguish the Turkish soldiers. It is true it is
a queer sort of pleasure to see people killing one another, yet every
evening and every morning I got on to my cart and remained for
hours at a time, watching: nor was I the only one who did so. The
sight was really fine, especially at night. At night my soldiers usually
undertake trench-work, and the Turks fling themselves upon them to
hinder them; then one should see and hear the fusillade! The first
night I passed in camp, this dreadful noise awoke and frightened me:
I thought an assault had begun. I very soon had my horse saddled;
but those who had been already some time in camp told me that I had
only to keep quiet: that this cannonade and fusillade was an ordinary
affair, and they jestingly called it 'Allah.' Then I lay down again;
but not being able to sleep, I amused myself, watch in hand, counting
the cannon-shots, and I counted 110 reports in a minute. And yet,
at close quarters, all this did not look so terrible as might be supposed.
At night, when nothing was visible, it was a case of who could burn
most powder, and with all these thousands of cannon-shots at most
some thirty men were killed on each side....</p>

<p>This then was an ordinary performance we had every day, and one
in which I took a share when I was sent to the trenches with orders;
but we also had extraordinary performances, such as the one on the eve
of the attack, when a mine of 240 poods (8600 lbs.) of gunpowder was
exploded under one of the enemy's bastions. On the morning of that
day the Prince had been to the trenches with all his staff (and as the
General I was attached to belong to it, I was there too) to make the
final arrangements for next day's assault. The plan&mdash;too long for me
to explain here&mdash;was so well arranged, all was so well foreseen, that
no one doubted its success. Apropos of this I must tell you further
that I am beginning to feel admiration for the Prince (for that
matter you should hear how the officers and soldiers speak of him:
not only have I never heard him spoken ill of, but he is generally
adored).</p>

<p>That morning I saw him under fire for the first time. You should
see his rather absurd tall figure, his hands behind his back, his cap on
the back of his head, his spectacles, and his way of speaking like a
turkey-cock. One could see that he was so preoccupied with the
general trend of affairs that the balls and bullets did not exist as far
as he was concerned. He exposes himself to danger so simply that
one would say he was unconscious of it, and involuntarily one fears
it only for oneself; [The text here is obscure, and the meaning a
little doubtful] and then he gives his orders with such clearness and
precision, and is at the same time always so affable with everybody.
He is a great man, <i>i.e.</i> a capable and honest man, as I understand the
word: one who has dedicated his whole life to the service of his
country, and not from ambition, but for the sake of duty. I will give
you a trait of his character connected with the story I had begun to tell
you of the assault. After dinner that same day, the mine was sprung,
and nearly 600 guns opened fire on the fort we wished to take, and
this continued the whole night. It was such a sight and such an
emotion as one never forgets. That evening the Prince, amid all
the commotion, went to sleep in the trenches, that he might
personally direct the assault, which was to begin at 3 o'clock the
same night.</p>

<p>We were all there, and as usual on the eve of a battle, we all made
believe not to think of the morrow more than of any other day, and
we all, I am sure, at bottom, felt our hearts contract a little (and not
a little, but a great deal) at the thought of the assault. As you know,
the time before a fight is the most disagreeable: it is only then that
one has time to be afraid, and fear is a most disagreeable feeling.
Towards morning, the nearer the moment came the more the feeling
diminished, and towards 3 o'clock when we were all expecting to see
a shower of rockets let off, which was the signal for the attack,
I was so well inclined for it that I should have been much disappointed
if any one had come to tell me that the attack was not to
take place. And there! Just an hour before the time for the attack,
an aide-de-camp comes from the Field-Marshal [Paskévitch, who for
a time took over the supreme command of the army of the Danube]
with orders to raise the siege of Silistria! I can say, without fear of
making a mistake, that this news was received by all, soldiers, officers,
and generals, as a real misfortune, the more so as we knew from the
spies&mdash;who very often came to us from Silistria, and with whom I very
often had occasion to speak&mdash;that once we had taken this fort (about
which none of us felt any doubt) Silistria could not have held out for
more than 2 or 3 days. Is it not true that if this news was calculated
to pain any one, it must have been the Prince, who having all through
this campaign arranged everything for the best, yet saw, in the very
middle of the action, the Field-Marshal override him and spoil the
business? Having this one chance to repair our reverses by this
assault, he received counter-orders from the Field-Marshal at the
moment of commencing! Well, the Prince was not put out of temper
for a moment. He who is so impressionable, was, on the contrary,
pleased to be able to avoid that butchery, the responsibility for which
he would have had to bear; and during the whole time of the retreat&mdash;which
he directed personally, not wishing to cross (the Danube)
before the last of the soldiers&mdash;which took place with remarkable
order and exactitude, he was gayer than he has ever been. What
contributed much to his good humour, was the emigration of nearly
7000 Bulgarian families, whom we took with us as a reminder of the
ferocity of the Turks: a ferocity in which, in spite of my incredulity,
I was obliged to believe. As soon as we quitted the different Bulgarian
villages we had occupied, the Turks returned to them, and
except women young enough for a harem, they made a clean sweep of
all that was in them. There was one village to which I went from the
camp for milk and fruit, which had been exterminated in this way.
So, as soon as the Prince let the Bulgarians know that those who
wished to, could cross the Danube with our army and could become
Russian subjects, the whole country rose, and with their wives,
children, horses and cattle, came to the bridge: but as it was impossible
to take them all, the Prince was obliged to refuse the last
arrivals, and you should have seen how it grieved him to do so. He
received all the deputations which came from these poor folk, and
spoke with them all: trying to explain the impossibility of the
matter, offering to let them cross without their carts and cattle,
charging himself with their support till they could reach Russia, and
out of his own purse paying for private ships to transport them; in a
word, doing his very best for the welfare of these people.</p>

<p>Yes, dear Aunt, I should much like your prophecy to come true.
What I desire most is to be aide-de-camp to such a man as he, whom
I love and esteem from the bottom of my heart. Adieu, dear and
kind Aunt. I kiss your hands.</p>

the siege still goes on.... I think I have mentioned an occupation
I had in view, which promised very well&mdash;as I may say, now that it
is settled. I had the idea of founding a military newspaper. This
project, at which I worked with the co-operation of many very distinguished
men, was approved by the Prince and submitted to His
Majesty for his consent, but he has refused.</p>

<p>This disappointment has, I confess, distressed me greatly, and has
much altered my plans. If God wills that the Crimean campaign
should end well, and if I do not receive an appointment that satisfies
me, and if there is no war in Russia, I shall leave the army and go
to Petersburg to the Military Academy. I have formed this plan,
(1) because I do not want to abandon literature, at which it is impossible
to work amid this camp life; (2) because it seems to me that
I am becoming ambitious: not ambitious, but I want to do some
good, and to do it one must be something more than a Sub-Lieutenant,
and (3) because I shall see you all and all my friends.</p>

come to Moscow to pass some days with Mary, and to take leave of
you. (See sentences in English in letter above.)</p>

<p>But now I have reconsidered the matter, especially on
Máshenka's advice, and have decided to remain with her here
a week or two and then to go straight through Warsaw to
Paris. You no doubt understand, <i>chère tante</i>, why I do not
wish and why it is not right for me to come now to Yásnaya,
or rather to Soudakóva. I, it seems, have acted very badly in
relation to V., but were I to see her now, I should behave still
worse. As I wrote you, I am more than indifferent to her, and
feel that I can no longer deceive either her or myself. But
were I to come, I might perhaps, from weakness of character,
again delude myself.</p>

<p>Do you remember, dear Aunt, how you made fun of me when I
told you I was going to Petersburg 'to test myself'? Yet it is that
idea that has saved me from bringing misery on the young lady and
on myself; for do not suppose that it is a case of inconstancy or unfaithfulness.
No one has taken my fancy during these two months,
but simply I have come to see that I was deceiving myself, and that
I not only never had, but never shall have, the least feeling of true
love for V. V. A. The only things which give me much pain are
that I have hurt the young lady, and that I cannot take leave of you
before my departure....</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> If Mlle. Vergani, who has written me so absurd a letter, would
remember my whole conduct towards V. V. A., how I tried to come
as seldom as possible, and how it was she who induced me to come
more frequently and to enter into closer relations. I understand her
being vexed that an affair she much desired has not come off (I perhaps
am more vexed about it than she) but that is no reason for her
to tell a man who has tried to act as well as he could, and who has
made sacrifices in order not to make others unhappy, that he is a pig,
and to spread that report about. I am sure all Toúla is convinced
that I am the greatest of monsters....</p>

day I said to myself that I had done well to come abroad. I went very
little either into society or into the literary world, or into the world of
<i>cafés</i> and public balls; but in spite of that I found so many things
that were new and interesting to me, that every day on going to bed
I said to myself, 'What a pity the day has passed so quickly.' I have
not even had time to work, which I intended to do.</p>

could be so in love.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> I have just received your letter, dear Aunt, which found me, as you
must know from my last letter, at Clarens, in the neighbourhood of
Geneva, in the same village where Rousseau's Julie lived.... I will
not try to depict the beauty of this country, especially at present
when all is in leaf and flower; I will only say that it is literally impossible
to detach oneself from this lake and from these banks, and
that I spend most of my time gazing and admiring while I walk, or
simply sit at the window of my room.</p>

<p>I do not cease congratulating myself on the thought which made
me leave Paris and come to pass the spring here, though I have
thereby deserved your reproach for inconstancy. Truly I am happy,
and begin to feel the advantage of having been born with a caul.</p>

<p>There is some charming Russian society here: les Poúshkins, the
Karamzíns and the Mestchérskys; and they have all, Heaven

or 'To-the-People' movement in which so many young men and women were
risking and sacrificing home, property, freedom, and life itself, from motives
which had much in common with his own perception that the upper
layers of 'Society' are parasitic, and prey on the vitals of the people who
support them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
